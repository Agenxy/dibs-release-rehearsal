# Changelog

Notable changes to Dibs. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A closed-target full-publication rehearsal shares the release publisher and
  records exact source objects, draft discovery/upload/readback, immutable public
  asset hashes and a read-only retry. Production preflight, tag creation and
  publication authenticate that exact-candidate Actions proof again. Its scratch
  repository is the operator-approved public `Agenxy/dibs-release-rehearsal`;
  no live rehearsal or release is claimed. Rehearsal signatures cannot satisfy
  installed production trust, and registry/cask outputs are dry plans, not live
  acceptance.
  Metadata reads use only the existing job token at the GitHub API origin for
  rate limits, never as signature authority or on asset/CDN requests. Shared
  workflow tool/action pins are checked for parity; Syft is explicitly pinned.
  A separately named read-only workflow enters the unchanged production
  validator with the production repository's job token, without a build, tag,
  publication or release-finalizer trigger. This is a measurement door, not a
  successful cross-repository or live release claim.

### Fixed

- **Scratch cask plans name the actual immutable rehearsal payload.** The three
  generated archive URL/checksum pairs are verified before the rehearsal-only
  signing stage binds them to its closed repository and unique release tag.
  Production cask bytes and production signature trust remain unchanged. The
  initial public rehearsal exposed this mismatch after publishing its payload
  but before eligible evidence; that immutable failed attempt is retained.

- **Source installs reject conflicting version overrides before replacement.**
  Both built images are checked against their module/VCS-derived stamp. A
  hand-set `build.Version` that changes the normal pseudo-version now stops
  `task install` before signing or replacing installed binaries; clean-clone
  installs retain their normal version shape.

- **Over-budget outcomes share one pointer per request.** Unquoted selected
  progress/review/verdict units collapse into one counted `read_mail` summary,
  preserving both the global unit limit and the unread suffix. Complete words
  remain quoted and durably read; summaries never count as read receipts.

- **Codex queue wakes coalesce across verdicts and writer processes.** Pending
  answer and other verdict notices now reuse the core event vocabulary. A
  private OS file lock covers observation, enqueue and receipt retention across
  daemon and bridge processes, and queue fallbacks use the same admission door.
  The unavailable-observer fallback retains its documented bounded duplicate
  trade against losing a wake; app-opening policy stays the same.

- **Claude socket wakes coalesce until a new turn starts.** Busy sessions and
  informational-only mail use their existing full-mail hooks. Idle sessions
  wake for requests, questions, handoffs, human notifications, answers,
  grant/adoption verdicts, denials, declines, flagged reviews and due declared
  waits; ordinary work approvals use the hook path. DONE wakes a sender that
  currently declares it is waiting. Due slots keep independent clocks and
  bounded retries. Busy evidence falls back to unknown after 30 minutes of
  silence, so a lost Stop or an external token call cannot disable waking.
  Unknown sessions retain a bounded recovery grace. Shared
  mailboxes use one authenticated batch and one host/session wake epoch;
  failed writes retain hook fallback. Senders are told when a positively dead
  harness has no delivery route. Routine strict-hook identity omission is
  logged at Debug, with actual dropped information still at Info.

- **Outcome updates carry the responder's actual words.** Authenticated pulls,
  delivering lifecycle hooks and socket digests share the mail-first body budget
  (1,600 Unicode characters total, 700 per body). Complete outcome prefixes are
  durably read; partial quotes and pointers stay unread. Socket writes alone
  are not a read receipt. Requests are newest-first, reports within a request
  oldest-first, with at most 16 outcome units per delivery.
- **Reviews after DONE survive a restart.** Retained recipient reviews have
  an independent durable read marker. A recorded upgrade cutoff suppresses
  historical review floods. Acknowledging a newer progress/review event reads
  its prefix, names older entries in `also_read`, and repeating it writes
  nothing. Acceptance of an unreported milestone index is refused only at
  ingress; historical operations still replay unchanged.

- Release discovery lists bounded, paginated GitHub releases and matches the
  exact tag, including an existing draft that the get-by-tag endpoint omits.
  Duplicate matches, incomplete scans and API failures refuse publication;
  public releases still receive only immutable, signature-backed verification.

- **App reconnects reconsider waiting mail before a model call.** A new
  ChatGPT app process observed by its stdio bridges triggers one bounded
  recovery decision for app-owned agents on the same host. Inferred pending
  receipts are invalidated; an actual queued notice is retained. Delivery
  rechecks current mail and uses the existing loaded-thread and away policy,
  without changing agent identity or coordination history. Sender notes now
  distinguish confirmed app queue acceptance from an unconfirmed attempt.

## [0.0.11] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- **Cloud-agent (guest) access is shipped but not yet supported.** Invitations
  remain `INCOMPLETE` until the supporting minimum is set in a later release;
  no installed cloud harness or WAN deployment has been accepted. The
  endpoint-scoped `dibs mcp-stdio --guest <absolute-private-file>` adapter
  uses only the invited endpoint, constrained guest CA and bearer, without
  creating a local board or importing trust into the harness or system.
  Recovery uses the recipe's nonce or an isolated private store.

- **Private guest exports prepare a verified bridge without installing it.**
  `dibs invite <name> --out <absolute-private-file>` returns the issuer's
  exact expiry and an export-only recovery nonce. Reissuance keeps that nonce;
  ordinary mints disclose neither the nonce nor provisioning instructions.
  Publication is exclusive, atomic and synced, never an overwrite.
  Admitted release snapshots can render credential-free steps for Darwin arm64,
  Linux amd64 and Linux arm64: download, archive hash, stdout-only member
  extraction, executable hash and exclusive versioned publication, plus
  mergeable stdio configuration. Every error stops provisioning; existing
  versions stay intact. The unset minimum currently offers neither release
  metadata nor provisioning. Exports remain `INCOMPLETE`.

- **Signature-backed release evidence is retained for offline guest admission.**
  Signed upgrades retain the exact tag, checksums and signature bundle.
  `dibs invite --verify-release <tag>` is a separate explicit verification
  operation, not a mint or installer; only it may repair refused evidence
  online. Admission re-verifies bounded retained evidence offline against the
  embedded Sigstore root. Its success-only cache keys exact record content
  and the running build; changed or refused evidence withdraws only artifact
  metadata, not ordinary invite/list/revoke access. An unset supporting
  minimum refuses verification before I/O.

- **Release integrity covers the packaged guest CLI.** Signed
  `checksums.txt` includes platform-scoped executable-member digests from
  final code-signed images. The archive gate extracts all three targets and
  checks exact equality with the signing input. Release preparation checks
  the embedded Sigstore root against authenticated production TUF before
  stamping a version; the tag workflow repeats that check. Ordinary CI does
  not fetch third-party trust, and root rotation is never automatic.

- **Opt-in direct IPv6 guest TLS.** An operator-asserted global
  `--public-ip` selects an invitation-only TLS 1.3 listener without a domain
  or relay. Its constrained CA and private key are separate from fleet trust.
  Assignment loss or failed leaf renewal withdraws that endpoint, not the
  private board. Enabling requires `--ack-unverified-guest-client`; a
  native-client recipe remains withheld pending exact-runtime malicious-
  certificate acceptance. Automatic Supgang address selection and guest-pin
  advertisement remain follow-ups.

- **Scoped invitations can be issued by local agents.** Default policy permits
  four live own-ID-prefixed children for seven days; coordinators may name new
  unprivileged identities. The human's proved private CLI route may issue or
  revoke any invitation. Only credential hashes persist. Revocation, expiry,
  issuer closure and purge take effect on the next call; reopening an issuer
  does not restore its children. Invited agents cannot mint grandchildren.
  The separate public listener exposes POST `/mcp` and scoped `/files/`
  capabilities, never private board routes, wake streams or hub paths.
  `--public-url` supports a loopback TLS proxy; `--public-host` supports
  ACME with explicit terms acceptance. Live public deployment is unmeasured.

- **Encrypted out-of-band file transfer.** `upload`/`download` return
  short-lived descriptors; resumable PATCH/HEAD moves bytes outside MCP and
  model context. `dibs put`/`dibs get` retry cut connections and verify
  hashes. Versioned DARE 2 chunks authenticate ciphertext and final segments
  while legacy blobs remain readable. Revocation, identity replacement and
  access loss invalidate tickets, and concurrent staging is bounded.
  Native off-host transfer requires TLS 1.3. Downloads are sandboxed forced
  attachments, not executable board-origin content. Phase one resumes
  connections, not incomplete uploads after daemon restart; declared-size-
  and-digest restart resume remains a required follow-up.

- **Accepted work has a durable recipient-owned task queue.** Recipients can
  accept work for later, reprioritise or reorder it, and start it themselves.
  Queued work stays owed across restarts without triggering continuation or
  stall reports. Completing work never starts the next request. The human,
  coordinators and admins may lock order, but cannot prevent starting.
  Senders receive recorded ordering news; public views omit private bodies.

- **Senders can withdraw unfinished ordinary requests.**
  `respond(disposition: "withdraw", body: reason, superseded_by: serial)`
  retracts pending, queued or approved work without claiming delivery,
  clears queue/owed debt and gives the recipient a restart-safe acknowledgment
  receipt. A replacement reference neither assigns nor starts work. Tracked
  requests become cancelled; performed grant/adoption approvals stay final.

- **Milestones make long work reviewable.** Requests may name up to eight
  milestones. Workers report progress and deliverables, and close delivered
  work with `done`; senders may accept or flag each step without cancelling
  it. The board shows progress, artifacts and latest review. Acknowledging a
  notice is not a review, and a new report becomes unreviewed. A flagged
  completed request can receive corrections without changing its original
  verdict or artifact. New terminal responses remain readable for 24 hours;
  unresolved flags retain them within the terminal cap and loss watermark.

- **A tracked request is an MCP task.** A per-call-capable 2026-07-28 host
  using `send(type: "request", track: true)` receives a task handle and
  follows progress with `tasks/get` or task subscriptions. Denied, declined
  and expired requests complete with an error; delivered work carries its
  artifact. Handles survive restart, are unguessable and retain the request
  for the task's week unless the recipient is purged first. Unsupported hosts
  get an explicit tracking note and the ordinary result, not a task handle.
  Task capability and authorization are checked on every call.

- **Human notifications have delivery evidence.** Send reports the actual
  relay, desktop or unavailable route. Mail receipts distinguish pending from
  OS-confirmed posting, explicit dismissal, failure and an answer. Posting
  never proves visibility; evidence is derived and becomes unknown after
  restart. Failed notification attempts propagate their errors without
  duplicate alerts.

- **`dibs human-relay` puts human mail on the person's own Mac.** Enrollment
  binds a Secure Enclave key with the board's admin proof; running costs Touch
  ID, and an approval granting authority or another mailbox costs another
  confirmation. Answers return signed, including to Linux boards. The relay
  never holds the board's coordination secret. Without one, the board uses
  its own notification route.

- **ChatGPT conversations can participate without claiming a computer.**
  `dibs mcp-stdio --remote-session` works through OpenAI's Secure MCP Tunnel
  without asserting a host, process, directory or repository. Conversation
  IDs correlate calls and grant no authority. These participants may use
  mail, spaces, requests and path-free declarations, but cannot claim a
  directory or receive a wake; they collect mail at activation.

- **Blocked work can be parked honestly.** A `waiting` declaration whose
  refs include the owed request parks it with an optional timed recheck.
  Delivered Dibs wakes may continue a turn ending with declared work open,
  at most twice per declaration version and three times per fifteen minutes,
  never after a person's prompt. Stalled work is retried on bounded backoff
  and reported to its requester. Waiting work is not continued.

- **Relocation is separate from waking.** The `relocate` tool and operator
  CLI deliberately move a closed agent into another environment, ledgering
  who asked. Coordinators/admins may relocate; other agents need a human-
  granted permission. Running agents, cross-machine moves and the human row
  are refused. No wake reads or runs the relocation command table.

### Changed

- **Wakes deliver into the agent's existing harness; Dibs never hosts one.**
  Agent-hosting resume commands are refused. The retired Codex recipe is
  repaired to `codex queue`, never headless `exec resume`. Loaded app
  threads receive queued mail without opening their window. Unloaded app
  threads open only while the person is known away: screen locked, displays
  asleep or no input for `open_app_after_idle` (ten minutes by default).
  Presence is rechecked; unknown measurements leave mail queued. The helper
  makes a best-effort attempt to restore the previous frontmost app while the
  person remains away; restoration from a different app has not yet been
  observed. Bridge ancestry identifies the app, with transcript provenance as
  fallback; terminal sessions are never opened in an app.
  Closed Claude app sessions use the app's own continuation link, then their
  ordinary socket/startup route. Old bridges need a restart to adopt the policy.

- **The board panel opens only for an explicit human request.** `board`
  is the only tool that draws it, with an optional mail/activity view; the
  `board` prompt gives hosts a human entry point. Routine status uses
  `check_in` or `inbox`. Board calls log caller/view, never tokens or
  bodies. Activity now carries the most recent forty visible events.

- **Socket and lifecycle deliveries carry the digest, not an imperative.**
  Socket delivery carries bounded mail/update/announcement context; the
  configured command route carries only the event, with no participant names
  or private body in world-readable argv. Empty socket digests send nothing.
  Standing coordination guidance lives in registration and `dibs://skills`,
  not every notice. `[hooks] mail_bodies = false` restores pointer-only
  delivery; human/ambient notices never quote private bodies.

- **One writer owns each session socket.** A capable in-session bridge
  declares `com.dibs/self_wake` and the daemon stands down while that stream
  is open. Digests travel on the notification without a delivery-marking
  inbox read. If the socket is definitively gone, the bridge surrenders
  immediately; ambiguous failures keep the bounded retry before surrender.
  Reconnection then lets the daemon resume delivery. A new bridge facing an
  older daemon stays quiet rather than duplicating its notice.

- **Observation no longer suppresses wakes.** Event reads and background
  subscriptions do not manufacture active work. Native accepting delivery
  takes precedence over another watcher. Socket and Stop presentation share
  freshness only after successful socket delivery and receiver activity;
  held/failed sockets keep the hook fallback. Deferred wakes refresh their
  digest, omit already-handled mail and spend no cooldown on empty refreshes.

- **Liveness follows evidence, not a request for agents to announce it.**
  Authenticated contact, lifecycle hooks and ledger activity inform the
  board and sweep consistently. Boot grace is labelled as grace, not a
  sighting. Fresh authenticated calls keep a row active through its idle
  lease even if its recorded PID is stale; diagnostics still show that PID
  dead, and a silent crashed session is detected. Background observers and
  boot grace cannot create this evidence. A declaration untouched for thirty
  minutes reads `declared`, not `working`.

- **`dibs await` survives restarts.** Read-only reconnection follows the
  daemon's current address for up to two minutes and resumes from the cursor.
  Exit statuses distinguish events (0), timeout (1), and sustained daemon
  unreachability (75). Its exit status must not be hidden behind a pipeline.

- **Runtime settings and identity repair are explicit.** `settings` offers
  only immediately applicable settings, with admin authority for changes and
  recorded overrides separate from the operator's TOML. Unsupported keys
  refuse rather than pretending to work. `merge_agents` folds an abandoned
  duplicate's mailbox, claims and memberships into a survivor with traceable
  identity history; live sources and conflicting claims refuse. Unidentified
  hook sessions follow the operator's directory/strict/ask/coordinator policy.

### Fixed

- **The full release gate precedes the remote tag.** Protected-main dispatch
  proves the local annotated-tag environment and production-stamped packages
  before a separate job can push. An authenticated Actions receipt hands off
  to exact-tag publication, retaining the installed Sigstore identity. Draft
  assets are verified before publication; public retries never overwrite them.
  Registry and signed-cask retries require equivalence. Non-publishing
  rehearsals exercise failure and token delivery without creating a release.
  GitHub release immutability is a required operator-owned setting. Publication
  and cask retries require an immutable public release; an upload/publication
  race or lost response succeeds only after read-only verification of the
  exact signed assets, staged bytes and tag, never by retrying a public upload.

- **Release validation covers stable-stamped builds before tagging.** The
  daemon, CLI, updater and build-provenance packages run with a stable linker
  stamp in the local/main/PR gate. Guest fixtures use explicit versions rather
  than assuming an unstamped child is a development image; released issuers
  still refuse older bridge evidence.

- **Human identity survives rename and replay.** The reserved nonce restores
  the human row even dormant or archived, retaining its display name and
  mailbox. `send(to: "human")` works before the person visits the board;
  wake warnings, stall exemptions and adoption authority use the replayed
  identity. Ordinary member tokens gain no human authority.

- **Renamed agents are addressable without moving mailboxes.** IDs remain
  permanent mailbox/queue/contact keys; current names resolve at ingress.
  Exact IDs and human/coordinator role addresses win. Ambiguous names refuse
  with candidate IDs, and new renames onto another row's ID are refused.
  Historical records still replay without added ledger flags.

- **Human notifications leave focus alone.** Questions and requests use native
  banners, including during macOS Focus; no automatic decision window opens.
  Receipts preserve posting-time Focus as visibility unknown, with the
  person's exception hint. Doctor distinguishes allow-list and silence-list
  modes without claiming that a banner was hidden or seen.

- **Sleep no longer splits the live state from its ledger.** Deadlines and
  retention use the recorded wall clock. Retained expired-unanswered questions
  accept late answers; other expired verdicts remain final. Upgrade preflight
  names the ledger that `dibs verify` actually accepts.

- **Guest recovery refusal no longer kills its bridge.** Unsafe, corrupt or
  contended recovery stores refuse only that registration before HTTP with a
  cause-specific hint and no private path or nonce. Later calls still work;
  the bridge neither retries the refused mutation nor invents a notification
  response. Every invited HTTP request declares its actual compiled bridge
  version; once a floor is assigned, missing, development, prerelease and old
  versions refuse before MCP dispatch, without depending on initialize or
  granting authority. Private fleet traffic is unchanged.

- **MCP startup rides through daemon upgrades.** The stdio bridge gives
  modern discovery, legacy initialize and listing a bounded 25-second
  allowance, including an accepted connection that never answers. It forwards
  the daemon's real capabilities/version. Only refused connections are retried;
  mutation retries retain their existing ten-second bound.

- **Deferred and queued wakes no longer pile up.** Native queue observation
  reuses a pending Codex wake without resuming a thread or deleting messages.
  When observation is unavailable, a retained receipt is rearmed only by a
  session-start/prompt hook or expiry, not ordinary tool traffic. Commands
  recheck whether mail is still owed before running. One failed wake notifies
  the sender and appears on the board; repeated command failures back off
  rather than failing forever. A fresh agent call defeats a stale Stop record.

- **Lifecycle delivery matches each harness's output contract.** Claude Code
  SessionStart uses command hooks before its MCP clients exist; Stop sends
  the continuation decision as well as context. Codex Stop gets only the
  decision/reason its schema accepts. The push and hook routes both honor the
  configured wake policy. Informational updates delivered at Stop do not
  continue later turns, and milestone review clears its matching notice.

- **Accepting work no longer loses it to retention.** Approved and queued
  ordinary requests remain owed until delivered or declined, including across
  restart. Milestone acknowledgment before derived notice maps exist no
  longer crashes. Whole-work flags clear only through whole-work correction
  or acceptance; historical ledger retention keeps its original rules.

- **CLI help is side-effect free.** Every command answers `--help`/`-h`
  successfully before stdin, credentials or board contact. Usage includes
  actual flags and aliases; previously ignored cross-command flags now refuse.
  Bridge recovery hints name wait/retry and the read-only diagnostic, never
  ask an agent to install or start the shared daemon.

- **Inline attachments satisfy strict MCP schemas.** Embedded resources
  have stable contents URIs. Valid UTF-8 text/JSON remains readable; binary
  and mislabelled bytes preserve exact content as base64. These identities
  are not unauthenticated download routes.

- **Blob reconciliation cannot delete a newly registered attachment.**
  Writer-owned holds survive cancellation through commit/refusal, transfer
  across older overlapping cleanup snapshots and remain protected during
  shutdown. Hold checks and unlink share the store lock. Interrupted-upload
  clients now query HEAD after PATCH, not while their write is active.

- **A moved live session keeps its agent identity.** Live harness sidecars
  override a stale PID for crash decisions. Reattachment merges identity
  metadata rather than dropping existing fields. The awareness gate follows
  credential rotation, not sweep/wake guesses, so a live agent can declare
  after checking in. The retired stale reminder is diagnosed, not repeated.

- **Peer policy advice reflects the receiver's actual settings.** Doctor
  reads effective `crossSessionInbound` with managed/user/project precedence,
  distinguishes accepting, held, refused and unset, and prints the
  operator-owned remedy without applying it. Session socket delivery remains
  best effort, without a receipt.

- **Machine labels and paths retain their proper scope.** The board, CLI and
  bridge share a stable friendly label per host identity, including human and
  reporting rows. Raw labels remain in detail; unknown identities stay
  distinct. Repository/path/SSH identity rules are unchanged.

- **Review coordination is not duplicate implementation.** Complementary
  roles on the same item are described as such; same/unknown-role duplicates
  still warn. Deadline mistakes name `deadline_s`; sends that leave an ask
  unanswered name the required response. Once-a-day reattachment hints survive
  restarts, and old schemas' stringified typed arguments are safely coerced.

- **Upgraded bridges announce tool changes.** The server advertises
  `tools.listChanged`, and a re-executed bridge emits the changed-list notice.
  Claude Code refreshes it; measured Codex 0.159 only logs it, so its workers
  still rely on corrective hints and orientation for new arguments.

- **macOS replacement and release identity are stable.** A RunAtLoad
  replacement starts once, avoiding launchd restart throttling. Published
  binaries and source installs share the signing tool and explicit executable
  identities; the archive gate checks them. Stable self-signed identity
  preserves privacy/firewall grants across builds but does not remove
  Gatekeeper's first approval; Developer ID/notarization remains a separate
  membership decision.


## [0.0.10] - 2026-10-03

Burned: the immutable tag's release gate failed on two guest tests whose
development-version assumptions changed in a tagged checkout. No artifacts
were published and the registry job was skipped. The unreleased changes
above are carried forward to the next version; this tag will not be moved.

## [0.0.9] - 2026-09-22

### Added

- **`dibs upgrade` can find out about a release and go and get it.** It has
  always moved a fleet onto the dibd you had INSTALLED and said, in as many
  words, that it does not fetch: a defensible split that left a hole with
  nothing in it, because nothing anywhere told an operator a newer version
  existed. `--check` asks and changes nothing; `--fetch` gets the release,
  verifies the cosign signature over its checksums, checks the archive's
  digest, installs the whole payload (both binaries, the Touch ID helper and
  the notifier bundle) beside the daemon this machine runs, and only then
  performs the cutover that already existed, which proves the new binary can
  rebuild this board before stopping anything. `dibs doctor` asks the same
  question as a warning, and `DIBS_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` stops it asking.
  Nothing runs on a timer and the daemon never checks: every request Dibs
  makes to the network is one somebody asked for.

  Three refusals are as much of the design as the fetching. A **Homebrew**
  install is never self-replaced, because overwriting a file brew owns leaves
  its records and the disk disagreeing and the next `brew upgrade` puts the
  old build back with nothing explaining why; the operator gets
  `brew upgrade --cask dibs` instead. Without **cosign** it refuses rather
  than warning, because a checksum served beside the file it describes proves
  the download arrived intact and nothing about who made it, and this step
  decides which binary runs as a daemon; `--allow-unsigned` is there, typed by
  a person who has read why. And a cosign that is PRESENT but cannot run (a
  mise or asdf shim with no version selected looks exactly like this, and is
  what this machine had) is reported as a missing tool rather than as a failed
  verification: one means "install this" and the other means "do not run this
  binary", and the first draft said the second.

  Verified against the real v0.0.7 release, signature and all, into a
  throwaway directory. The digest is read from the bytes whose signature was
  checked rather than from a second copy fetched afterwards, which the first
  version of this got wrong: two fetches mean the file that was proved and
  the file that was used are not provably the same bytes. Found by reading
  the release surface before the tag, which is what that step is for.

- **`dibs configure --service` now says whether the daemon comes back at boot
  or only when you log in.** Both units it writes are user scoped: a launchd
  LaunchAgent lives in the `gui/<uid>` domain, which exists while that user is
  logged in at the screen, and a systemd user manager is torn down with the
  last session. The command described them as making the daemon "survive a
  closed terminal and a reboot", and only the first half was unconditional. On
  a laptop the distinction does not matter; on the always-on host somebody
  deploys a hub to, it is the difference between a board that survives a power
  cut and one that does not, and that host is the machine nobody is watching.
  The command now reports which case this machine is and names the setting
  that changes it (automatic login or a system LaunchDaemon on macOS,
  `loginctl enable-linger` on Linux), `dibs host-bridge --service` prints the
  same line, and `dibs doctor` re-checks it as a warning rather than a
  problem, because on a laptop the current behaviour is the right one. Found
  on the first machine Dibs was deployed to as a hub, where
  `launchctl print gui/501/org.agenxy.dibs` names the domain and the Mac has
  no automatic login.

- **Dibs now says when the machine's own firewall is swallowing the board.**
  macOS ships the Application Firewall enabled, and it drops inbound
  connections to an executable it has not been told about in the one way that
  leaves no evidence: the TCP handshake completes and `Accept` never fires, so
  the client hangs until it times out and the daemon logs a healthy startup and
  no traffic. It normally asks the person at the keyboard, and a daemon
  installed over ssh has nobody to ask. `dibd` now warns immediately after
  `dibd up` when it binds an address other machines can route to and the
  firewall will not let them through, and `dibs doctor` reports it as a problem
  and prints the fix. On an MDM-managed Mac it prints a settings pane instead
  of a command, because `socketfilterfw` refuses every modifying verb there.
  Found by deploying Dibs as a hub on a second Mac, where `dibd up` printed a
  board URL, the port answered a TCP probe, and the board was unreachable from
  every other computer on the LAN.


- **A Codex plugin, and `dibs codex-hooks --trust`, the step without which
  Codex delivers nothing.** The checkout is now a Codex marketplace
  (`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`) offering `dibs@dibs`: MCP server over
  stdio on 2026-07-28, the skill, and the three lifecycle hooks. Since Codex
  0.153 a hook from a local plugin or the user's config is untrusted until a
  person reviews it in the TUI, and an untrusted hook is dropped at discovery
  without a word, so an installed plugin delivered zero `hook_poll` calls per
  session (measured 2026-09-19 on 0.155.0-alpha.9.2; two with the review
  bypassed, which is the control). `dibs codex-hooks` lists the Dibs hooks as
  Codex reports them; `--trust` records their trust the way Codex's own
  `/hooks` does, through its app-server protocol (`hooks/list` for the key
  and hash Codex computes, `config/batchWrite` of `hooks.state`), touching
  nothing that is not a Dibs hook. `dibs doctor` reports the untrusted state
  until then. Verified: after trust, a plain `codex exec` session delivers
  SessionStart and Stop.

- **A hub's certificate is verified against the key its computer signed
  through Supgang, so joining it is one command and no fingerprint ceremony.**
  Supgang now carries service advertisements (its ADR 0002): a member signs,
  into its own record, that it runs `dibs` on a port behind a key. `dibs
  fingerprint` prints the board CA's key pin and the exact `supgang advertise
  dibs <port> --key-pin <pin>` for the hub's operator, and `dibs doctor` on the
  hub warns until it matches what the daemon serves (or is silent under a
  Supgang that predates advertisements). `dibs mcp-config --board <peer>` then
  joins on the advertised port, reads the pin from `supgang resolve`, checks
  the certificate the hub presents against it, records it in the board's data
  directory, and prints a recipe with nothing to compare; a certificate with
  another key is refused and no recipe is printed, because whatever answered is
  not that board. A hub that is not answering gets the pin carried into `dibs
  trust <host:port> --pin <hex>`, new, which makes the same comparison later.
  `internal/supgang` reads `supgang.peers/v6` and `supgang.resolve/v5` beside
  the previous majors, which they extend by one field.
- **`dibs host-bridge`: the machine's half of waking an agent on another
  machine.** The hub half shipped in #117; this is the command that runs on
  the joined machine. With the `DIBS_ADDR` and `DIBS_DIR` the join recipe
  printed, it reads the `[wake.exec]` table in that data directory, attaches
  to the hub's `dibs://wake` stream for this machine's host id stating the
  harnesses it can start, runs the operator's own command here through the
  same runner the daemon uses, and reports the exit status the hub then
  treats as its own observation. It delivers the one fixed wake sentence
  whatever the hub sent, refuses a request for another host or a harness it
  has no entry for, and reattaches with a growing pause when the stream
  ends. `dibs doctor` on the hub lists attached bridges and counts a remote
  agent whose bridge can start its harness as covered; on the joined machine
  it names whichever half is missing, the entries or the attachment.
  Exercised end to end by the two-host suite. `dibs host-bridge --service`
  writes the launchd or systemd unit that keeps the bridge running across
  logins and reboots, carrying the join recipe's variables and nothing else.


- **A board can have a name, routed by Remap.** The Agenxy name plane
  ([Remap](https://github.com/Agenxy/remap)) maps any hostname a person
  chooses to a service on their own machines, so Dibs does not grow a way
  of its own: `dibs configure` offers a name when Remap is installed and
  answering, registers it (`remap set <name> http://<addr>/`), and writes it
  to `dibs.toml` as `name`; the daemon accepts that name as its own origin
  so the board works at `http://<name>/`; `dibs web` prints the named link
  beside the address; `dibs doctor` says when the name is set and Remap does
  not route it. `internal/remap` is the whole of the dependency: `remap
  --json` over argv, its versioned envelope checked, its own codes and hints
  surfaced. Without Remap nothing changes.

- **The hub wakes agents on other machines through their own machine's
  bridge (hub half).** docs/NETWORK.md §5: the hub decides THAT an agent is
  woken, the agent's machine decides HOW. Every wake decision in the daemon
  (the cooldown, the deferral, the recency window, the attempt count, the
  exit re-check) now applies to a remote agent unchanged; only execution
  moves. A bridge on the other machine opens a `dibs://wake` stream naming
  its host and the harnesses its own `[wake.exec]` can start, the hub hands
  it each wake as a `resources/updated` notification carrying exactly what a
  `[wake.exec]` entry substitutes (thread, agent, sender, type, the one fixed
  sentence), and the bridge's `POST /api/wake-result` stands in for the exit
  status. The hub never learns a remote argv and never runs one, and its own
  `[wake.exec]` is no longer tried for an agent on another machine, which
  used to start a process here in a directory that is not here and spend
  the mail's one attempt on it. `GET /api/hosts` lists the attached bridges.
  The bridge command itself (`dibs host-bridge`) and doctor's account of it
  follow in the next change.
- **A two-host end-to-end suite.** `task test:remote` binds a hub to this
  machine's LAN address so that no caller arrives over loopback, joins it
  from a second data directory by the recipe `dibs mcp-config --board`
  prints (secret copied, fingerprint pinned with `dibs trust`), registers
  an agent through the real bridge on each side, and checks what SPEC §16
  and `docs/NETWORK.md` §3 promise through the real transport: each row
  carries the host its bridge asserted, the same absolute path on two
  machines is not a collision, the same file of one repository in two
  clones is, the refusal names the rule, and `dibs doctor` on the joining
  machine says whose board it is. Both rules were unit-tested in the fold
  and had never been exercised through the trust store and the bridge.
- **Dibs identifies computers through Supgang, and joins a hub by its Supgang
  name.** An Agenxy-wide decision (2026-09-13): the projects use each other
  as dependencies rather than duplicate. Dibs kept an identity of its own for
  each computer (`node_id`, a generated `host_id`) beside the one Supgang
  already gives it; now, on a Supgang member, the host id every agent carries
  IS the Supgang node id, on the hub (its own bridges assert it, and a
  loopback caller that asserts nothing is stamped with it)
  and on a joining machine (the bridge asserts it), so one computer answers
  to one name across the fleet; a daemon started before the machine joined
  its hive is told by `dibs doctor` to restart, since it keeps the ledger's
  id until then. `dibs mcp-config --board MacMarine` names the
  hub as a Supgang peer: the address Supgang has signed for it now, Dibs's
  own port, and `DIBS_BOARD_PEER` in the config so the bridge asks again each
  time it starts and follows the hub when its address changes. `dibs doctor`
  names the machine a remote agent is on. `internal/supgang` is the whole of
  the dependency: `supgang --json` over argv, versioned envelopes checked,
  Supgang's own words for a computer that has not joined a hive. Without
  Supgang everything works as before, for one machine or an ssh forward.
- **The registry entry carries an install path.** (#44) `io.github.Agenxy/dibs`
  had a name, a description and a repository and no `packages`, so an agent
  that found Dibs in the MCP registry had nothing that said what to fetch,
  and took its instructions from whichever aggregator outranked the
  repository. The release now packs the binaries GoReleaser built into an
  MCP Bundle (`tools/mcpbundle`: manifest 0.2, `server.type: binary`, the
  stdio bridge launched from inside the bundle), attaches `dibs.mcpb` and
  its digest to the release, and the registry job stamps a `packages` entry
  of type `mcpb` with the asset URL and `fileSha256` into `server.json`. The
  digest is computed from the bundle as attached, not read from the digest
  file beside it, and a digest file that disagrees refuses the publish. A
  release without the bundle publishes without the block and says so; a
  release that could not be examined fails the stamp rather than publishing
  the block's absence. The bundle is macOS on Apple silicon only, which is
  the only Mac build Dibs ships: a manifest selects a binary by operating
  system and not by architecture, so a Linux entry would hand every Linux
  host one build, and the compatibility list names darwin and nothing else.
  It cannot name an architecture, so an Intel Mac is told by the description
  and nowhere a manifest can enforce. Linux uses the release archives; there
  is no Windows build to point at, and the bundle no longer says there is
  (round seven of the pre-release review). Validated against the official
  `mcpb` CLI on a local snapshot.
- **A Linux notifier: the operator can be asked, not only shown.** (#63)
  `notify.Available()` was `runtime.GOOS == "darwin"`, so on Linux a request
  that needed a person (a role grant, a mailbox adoption) waited on the board
  until somebody looked, and the mechanism by which a human stays the
  authority over a fleet was absent there. libnotify's `notify-send` has had
  buttons (`--action`) and `--wait` since 0.7.10, which is exactly the shape
  `Ask` needs: one subprocess, argv only, the pressed key on stdout. Each way
  the machine cannot ask is its own `dibs doctor` sentence: no `notify-send`
  (install libnotify), no session bus (headless: approvals wait on the board,
  `dibs web`), or a libnotify older than 0.7.10, which can show and cannot
  ask and is refused rather than degraded to a banner nobody can answer; and
  a notification daemon that advertises no `actions` capability
  (`GetCapabilities` over `dbus-send` or `gdbus`), which is the same refusal
  one layer down. Text entry has no notify-send form and says so. Exercised
  against a stub that speaks notify-send's and dbus-send's argv; not yet
  against a Linux desktop.
- **Windows builds and vets in CI, and the first run says what does not
  hold.** (#11) "Not supported and not being worked on" became "nobody has
  tried" became a runner: `ubuntu-latest` runs the whole suite under the race
  detector and `windows-latest` builds, vets and runs the packages that hold
  there. The first run said the state machine, the ledger and the board
  config failed on path separators and file semantics; each was the test or
  the fold assuming unix and is fixed in this version (#113, above), so the
  Windows job now runs core, ledger, board config, the scorer, the liveness
  parsers and the daemon-registry lock. To get there the daemon's file lock
  is `LockFileEx` on Windows behind the same three calls `flock` answers on
  unix, the liveness poller asks the kernel whether a pid still runs, and the
  tests that send signals carry the unix build tag. The README says what
  that is and is not: a build, not a support statement; no Windows harness
  has registered an agent.

- **The daemon no longer needs read access to your checkouts.** (#19)
  Matching mined the repository itself, so `dibd` needed to read every tree
  its agents work in, and on macOS a daemon started by launchd is not granted
  `~/Desktop`, `~/Documents` or `~/Downloads`: `/usr/bin/git` blocks there on
  a prompt no background process can show, and the only grant that reliably
  applies is Full Disk Access, which a coordination daemon should not hold.
  The agent already has the access and is already inside the repository, so
  its stdio bridge now ships the two bounded things the index is built from
  (tracked paths, commit subjects with the files each touched; never
  contents) when, and only when, the daemon reports it could not read the
  tree. `POST /api/index` accepts it for the tree the agent is registered in
  and no other, the daemon keeps its own reading of any tree it can read,
  and `dibs doctor` names the tree and the agent that shipped it. A shipped
  index predicts what the mined one predicts; the test proves it against this
  repository's own history.
- **A Gemini CLI plugin, and `dibs hook-poll` for harnesses whose hooks are
  subprocesses.** (#24) Gemini's hooks are `command` type only, and its
  `SessionStart` accepts `additionalContext`, so `plugins/gemini-cli` ships a
  session-start hook running `dibs hook-poll`: it reads the hook's JSON on
  stdin, asks the daemon what is waiting for the session's agent, and prints
  the strict-shape answer Gemini injects as the first turn's context. Past
  session start Gemini is pull-only, and the README says why in Gemini's own
  terms: its end-of-turn hook can only reject the model's answer or stop the
  session, and Dibs will not deliver mail by discarding what an agent said.
  Measured on 2026-09-12 against 0.54.0-nightly: the hook reached the daemon
  from a headless session, and Gemini negotiates `2025-06-18` over `httpUrl`
  (the wake table has the row). `dibs://plugin` knows the harness and its
  spellings.
- **A live session that stopped coordinating is told so.** (#53) An agent
  that registers, declares and then works for hours without calling Dibs
  reads as dormant while it is busy, and peers writing to it are told so; on
  this project's board that expired a peer's question and was reported as
  the product failing. `[wake] remind_stale_after` (default `1h`, `off` to
  disable) adds one line to the hook digest naming the silence and the
  corrective call (`check_in`, then `update` or `declare`). It never extends
  a turn: it rides on a digest delivered for another reason and on the
  ambient line to the person, and repeats no more often than the interval.
  A single long turn has no hook to ride, which the documentation says
  plainly.
- **A coordinator can count a mailbox without reading it.** (#77)
  `all_mail(census: true)` returns, per mailbox, how many messages, of which
  types, from whom, how old, how many still awaiting an answer, and how many
  never retrieved: never a body. Custody and contents are different
  capabilities and only one is sensitive; a coordinator consolidating stranded
  rows needs the first, and the only door to it was the second, which refused.
  Of three rows consolidated on this project's board, two held nothing, and
  before this the only way to learn that was to adopt them and look. `agent`
  names one mailbox, reported even when empty.

- The frozen-json-tag guard now covers `core.AgentInfo` as well as `core.Op`.
  Those tags travel to disk inside `op.agent` and not one of them was frozen:
  renaming `repo_dir`, `repo_remote` or `repo_roots` would have replayed as
  "no evidence" on every historical op, and the fold would have quietly stopped
  telling one repository from another while reporting success. That is the
  `lane_kind` failure exactly, in the one struct the guard did not look inside.

- `docs/NETWORK.md`: the design for a board whose agents are not all on one
  computer. Host identity as a key rather than a hostname, claims keyed by host
  with a portable repository form beside them, liveness split into presence and
  identity, and why wake routes must belong to the machine the agent is on
  rather than to the hub. Written before most of it existed; by this
  release the liveness split, the host key, the portable repository rule and
  the per-host bridge are built (each has its own entry here), and the
  document's status line says what remains.

### Changed

- **Dependabot updates the browser test dependencies through the `bun`
  ecosystem, not `npm`.** This directory's lockfile is `bun.lock` and the gate
  installs with `--frozen-lockfile`; under the npm ecosystem Dependabot edited
  `package.json` and left the lockfile alone, so every pull request it raised
  there failed on "lockfile had changes, but lockfile is frozen". One sat open
  red for a week on a public repository, updating nothing. The trade is that
  the bun ecosystem does version updates and not security updates, which is
  worth it here: these are browser test dependencies in no shipped artifact,
  and a security update that cannot merge is not a security update.
  `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps` goes to 2.0.0 with this, the bump that was
  stuck; the panel suite passes 90/90 against it unchanged.

- **One place decides whether an address is loopback.** There were five: the
  shared `internal/transport.IsLoopback` and four hand-copies, which disagreed
  one input at a time. One read a wildcard `:4777` bind as confined to this
  machine and handed a board bound wide an ssh-forward recipe it could not
  follow; that was fixed in the copy, with a comment noting that the shared
  code already read it correctly. Two more carried comments naming
  `internal/transport` as the real rule while restating it anyway, and one was
  dead code. The answer decides plaintext versus TLS and forward versus trust,
  so a second opinion about it is a second answer.
  `TestOnlyOnePlaceDecidesWhetherAnAddressIsLoopback` keeps it folded by shape.
  `internal/mcp` keeps its own, deliberately and with the reason recorded: it
  reads a PEER's address, where a name is not proof of anything.

- **A new mark: three agents, one of them holding a claim.** The old one was
  two paths merging into one, drawn when this project was called Lanes and
  saying "lanes converge". The name went in August 2026 and `lane` is retired
  everywhere else in the tree with guards to keep it out; the logo kept saying
  it because no guard looks at artwork. Three filled dots also survive being
  small, which the merging strokes did not: at 16px the junction and the three
  lines resolved into a smudge. The peers are drawn at equal weight because
  neither is subordinate, and the holder is distinguished by colour rather
  than by size, because what sets it apart is not rank.

  `docs/dibs-mark.svg`, a third design drawn for the rename and never wired
  in, goes with it, and so does `docs/social-preview.png`, a Lanes-era card
  referenced by nothing and superseded by the one GitHub actually serves. The
  drift guard now covers the two SVG copies as well as the four PNGs: they
  diverged once before, the fix landed on the documentation copy alone, and
  the one compiled into the binary stayed broken while the repository looked
  repaired.


- **Every lookup that takes a directory now takes the machine too, by
  construction.** "A path is evidence on one computer" had been learned six
  separate times here, five of them the review finding it missing somewhere
  new, one call site per round. The unscoped lookups are gone rather than
  documented: `ActiveAgentsIn`, `ActiveAgentIDsIn`, `AgentsIn`,
  `ReattachableIn` and `AgentForHook` are replaced by their `On` siblings,
  which take the host. Two of them were wrong in ways nothing had reported:
  a hook that resolved to nobody was logged as "the wake path is reaching no
  one" because a peer machine had a directory of the same name, and an
  unregistered session was offered the names of idle agents **on other
  machines** to reattach to, which is an invitation to adopt a different
  computer's identity. `TestNoExportedLookupTakesADirectoryWithoutAMachine`
  keeps the surface that way.


- **Dibs ships its mark where a mark is expected, instead of a placeholder.**
  The MCP Bundle and the Claude Desktop manifest declared no `icon` at all, so
  an extension a person installs sat in their list as a grey square beside
  named ones, and a board added to an iOS home screen took a screenshot of
  itself for its tile (`apple-touch-icon` has no SVG form). All four now carry
  the same file as the macOS app icon, held to it by
  `TestTheMarkIsTheSameFileEverywhereItShips`: `go:embed` and an MCPB `icon`
  path both need a copy beside them, so the copies are guarded the way
  `SKILLS.md` is.


- **`dibs doctor` asks the hub which machine is the hub, instead of guessing.**
  A bridge is a wake route for another machine's agents and never for a local
  one, and the hub's own `[wake.exec]` is the reverse, so every coverage
  answer turns on "is this agent on the hub". The engine reads several ids as
  itself: the one it stamps with, the ledger's node id for rows written before
  it had a Supgang identity, and every id it used to answer to. Doctor could
  see none of that and compared with the board's current id alone, so on a
  machine that adopted a Supgang identity its own older rows read as remote,
  in both of the directions that report health: the hub's own command stopped
  counting for them, and a bridge attached for that id started counting, which
  is the route the engine refuses outright for a local agent. `GET /api/hosts`
  now carries `self`, the set the daemon reads as itself, and doctor uses it;
  against a daemon too old to say, the previous comparison stands.
- **`internal/core` owns the pure rules it states, and nothing copies them
  any more.** Three places kept a hand-copy of something core already says,
  each with a comment explaining why it had to: `paths.Portable` duplicated
  the UNC path cleaning ("core may not import this package; the two must
  stay identical"), and `internal/overlap` duplicated two numeric bounds
  ("overlap sits below core and does not import it"), guarded by a test in
  `internal/mcp` that read overlap's source to check the literals still
  matched. Both premises were true about the direction they named and false
  about the one that mattered: core imports nothing, so everything can
  import core. `core.CleanPath` is exported and is now the only
  implementation; overlap reads `core.MaxFingerprintBytes` and
  `core.DefaultLimits().MaxPathBytes` directly; the drift guard is gone with
  the drift. A new check, `TestCoreImportsNothingThatCouldMakeItImpure`,
  keeps the reasoning true: it fails on a project import, a third-party
  import, or any standard-library import that could reach the disk, the
  clock, the network or the process, and it was shown catching all three.

- **The opencode and pi plugins are transports now, not clients: one
  implementation of every client rule, in Go.** Both spoke to the daemon
  themselves, and the pre-release review spent rounds nineteen through
  fifty-seven handing them, one at a time, rules the `dibs mcp-stdio` bridge
  already had: the host stamp, the repository stamp, canonical paths, the
  portable spelling of a Windows path, which arguments are paths at all, the
  exception for a path named on another agent's behalf, a TLS trust store
  Node's `fetch` cannot be given, an origin that has to be re-read because
  the hub moves. Each arrived a release after the bridge got it, and each was
  found in behaviour rather than by a test, because a rule that exists three
  times drifts and the symptom is silent on the copies nobody runs. Both
  files now speak JSON-RPC over a pipe to that bridge and decide nothing:
  1329 lines of TypeScript became 808, the four guards that pinned the copies
  to each other are replaced by one that forbids client policy in them at
  all, and the `resolved_host_id` / `resolved_origin` files the bridge wrote
  for those readers are gone with them. A child per call rather than a
  long-lived one, measured at 8-17ms against a running daemon with spawn
  included: under bun a piped child keeps the parent's event loop alive
  however it is unref'd, so the harness finished its turn and would not exit.
  Behaviour is unchanged for both harnesses (`task test:guard`, 38 checks
  against a real daemon), except that a hook call now reaches the daemon with
  a working directory the bridge supplies when the harness states none, which
  is where that rule landed when the plugins stopped measuring it.


- **The daemon calls itself Dibs everywhere a person can see it.**
  `serverInfo.name`, the string every MCP client puts in its list of
  servers, said `agents`: what this project was called two names ago. The
  renames to Lanes and then to Dibs swept the prose, the verbs, the docs
  and the manifests and missed the one field a person actually reads. It
  is `dibs` now, with the human `title` and the project's `websiteUrl`
  beside it, and a test refuses either retired name.

- **Every request this project makes says what it is.** They all went out
  as `Go-http-client/1.1`, so a hub's access log could not tell one
  machine's bridge from another's hook, from an index shipment, or from
  any other Go program on the network, and the build a caller is running
  was not there to read. Requests now carry `dibs/<version>
  (<os>/<arch>)`, stamped in the one client every credential-bearing call
  already passes through, and a caller that sets its own is left alone.

- **The board and the protocol guide carry the metadata a page is
  expected to have**: a description, a theme colour for each scheme, and
  an application name, beside the title and icon they already had.

- **SECURITY.md states what a forged lifecycle hook can and cannot do.**
  (#74) `hook_poll` takes a session id with no token, and a peer can claim a
  `Stop` or `SessionStart` for somebody else's session. The consequence was
  never written down: a forged `Stop` costs at most one spurious wake, and
  ONE forged `SessionStart` defers a wake by at most the harness's
  cooldown, because the deferral re-arms, which a test pins. A caller that
  REPEATS the forgery faster than the cooldown keeps deferring it for as
  long as it keeps calling, and there is no bound on that beyond the
  caller's persistence: SECURITY.md says so, and this entry claimed the
  one-cooldown bound for the repeated case too. Nothing on that path reads
  mail or grants a role. The fix that closes it is a credential per
  agent (`docs/NETWORK.md` §6); the document now says so instead of
  promising an isolation the design cannot give.

- **The scaling numbers are in the architecture document.** (#42) Where
  Dibs stops scaling was measured rather than guessed: the overlap search is
  linear in agents and, more to the point, serialised on the writer loop,
  which is fine at hundreds and the constraint at thousands. The numbers,
  where a prefix tree would help (paths) and would not (refs, scoring), and
  the order to do it in are now in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, so the next person
  reaches for a data structure when the fleet needs one and not before.
- **The bridge's per-agent cost is stated, and what it buys.** (#60) Nine
  idle stdio bridges measured 72 MB on one machine, about 8 MB, 13 file
  descriptors and a connection each, and every generated config prescribes
  one although the daemon serves MCP over HTTP directly. The README now
  gives the number and the reason the process is kept anyway: the bridge is
  the session. It is where `cwd`, `branch` and a real `pid` are observed
  rather than asked of a model, the key that reattaches the next turn to the
  same agent, and the exit the board notices when an agent dies. A url client
  gives up all four; the generated configs do not, and say so.
- **A coordinator may move a mailbox but not onto itself.** (#77) Adoption
  moves the messages an abandoned mailbox holds at that moment, once; it is
  not a standing redirect, and anything sent to the name afterwards still
  reaches it (the result says so). Onto a third party, the coordinator gains
  nothing, and that is the consolidation the role exists for. Onto itself, it
  becomes the reader of that mailbox's contents: the coordinator granting
  itself read access to another agent's mail, which is now the human's call
  (`human_unlock`) or an admin's. The refusal names the census and `into`.
  Approving another agent's adoption request makes that agent the reader,
  not the coordinator; a coordinator approving a request it sent ITSELF is
  the same move through the other door and is refused the same way (found by
  the pre-release review).

- **`check_in` charges for a roster, not the whole board.** (#55) The one
  call every agent must make, once per activation, returned every field of
  every row: 41 KB of a 71 KB checkpoint on this project's own 35-agent board,
  almost none of it read. It now returns one row per agent (id, status, who,
  what it is doing on one line, host, project, role) with claims whole in
  shape, and everything the call owes (mail, announcements, updates, the
  cursor) untouched. `detail: true` returns the full board as before; the
  human's panel never lost it. Measured 71 KB to 36 KB on that board.

### Fixed

- **The board stopped explaining its own marks when the fleet moved.** The
  little explainer on an agent badge is closed by `pointerout`, and a board
  redraws by replacing its HTML, which moves a node out from under the mouse
  cursor and makes the browser synthesise exactly that event. So a redraw hid
  an explanation the reader had opened with the keyboard, undoing the careful
  re-acquisition the redraw handler had just performed. Whether it happened
  depended on where the mouse happened to be resting, which is why it looked
  like flakiness in the browser suite for a while, on CI as well as locally,
  and why it took a trace rather than an argument to find: mutation, adopt,
  focusin, pointerout, hide, in that order, on a board redrawing by itself.
  The rule now is that the input which opened the explanation is the input
  that closes it, in all three directions: a mouse crossing empty board does
  not close what a tab key opened, and tabbing away does not close what the
  mouse is resting on. Caught by the release workflow re-running the gate
  against the tagged commit, which is what that step is for.

- **A bridge no longer goes stale when the board is reset or moves.**
  `dibs mcp-stdio` read `local.secret` once at spawn and sent that string for
  the life of the process, so resetting a board 401d every harness session
  already running, for the rest of its life: nine of them on one machine,
  each with a live bridge process, a reachable daemon and a credential for a
  board that no longer existed. The agent saw an authorisation error whose
  only remedy was "restart your harness", which is not something an agent can
  do, and the same staleness reached the subscription streams that reconnect
  on their own and the index shippers that retry for minutes. The credential
  is now taken from disk on every round trip, in the one transport every
  credential-bearing request passes through, so no caller has to remember.
  The board's ADDRESS had the same shape: resolved once and retried against
  forever, so a daemon that came back somewhere else was unreachable even
  though the new address was written in the config the bridge reads. It is
  re-resolved on retry and on stream reconnect, which costs nothing while
  things work, because a stale address has exactly one symptom. Between them
  the bridge now remembers nothing about this machine that this machine can
  change, which is what a stateless protocol asks of a process that outlives
  a request.


- **The board's home-screen icon reaches the browser.** The raster icon added
  for iOS went into both templates without going into the gate's closed list
  of routes a cookie alone may fetch, so a logged-in operator got a 401 where
  their tile should be: the same broken-icon symptom that list was written
  for, one icon later. A new check reads the shipped templates and requires
  every same-origin asset they reference to pass that tier, because a browser
  cannot put the page key on a `<link>` fetch and nothing else would say so.

- **A stall this machine observed is reported to an agent on this machine.**
  Supervision watches local processes, and attribution resolved the owner by
  session id without saying which computer. The bridge's `host-<ppid>`
  fallback repeats across machines, so another machine's agent could be told
  its subagent had stopped, and the pid was then marked reported: the agent
  that owns the stalled child never hears, and never will.


- **`check_in`'s compact board keeps what a claim COVERS, not just where.** A
  path is evidence on one computer and a repository-relative path on one
  repository, which is why a claim records its host and repository at claim
  time rather than reading the holder's current ones. The projection kept the
  path and dropped all three, so an agent that checked in could not tell a
  claim on its own `/workspace/repo` from an unrelated machine's, nor
  recognise its own file under another clone's root: the two mistakes those
  fields exist to prevent, at the last step before the model reads it. Notes
  and timestamps are still dropped, which is what the compaction is for.

- **`dibs doctor` no longer reports broken hooks because a peer machine has a
  directory of the same name.** The diagnostic that decides whether an
  unresolved hook is a misbinding or just an unregistered session asks whether
  any active agent in that directory could still be the caller, and compared
  the path alone. An agent on another machine cannot be the caller of anything
  here, so a peer holding the bridge's `host-<ppid>` fallback at a path of the
  same name turned a correctly routed fleet red. Hook resolution has narrowed
  by host since it learned to; the diagnostic beside it had the host in scope
  and threw it away.


- **A local remote no longer merges two strangers' objectives across
  machines.** The round before this gave `sameRepoIdentity` the rule that a
  `file:` remote names somewhere on one computer, and left `differentProjects`
  beside it without it: two agents cloned from `/srv/source` on two machines
  were "configured against the same upstream", so `issue:42` in each was
  reported as one objective, the strongest signal Dibs has, between agents who
  have never shared a line of code. Those two are the only places that compare
  a remote and both draw the line now. Root commits still decide it, on any
  number of machines, which is the case cross-host coordination is built on.

- **A restart no longer invents join notices for spaces you joined later, and
  they no longer push out a real instruction.** The notice rebuild runs over
  the whole replayed ring against a space's membership as it is NOW, so every
  join a space ever saw was announced to every member it has today, including
  ones who arrived afterwards. The queue is bounded and keeps the newest, so
  enough restored joins evicted an unread eviction: an agent told to stop work
  carried on, after the restart that was supposed to make that impossible. A
  join is news only to members who were already there.


- **A bridge that dies mid-write no longer takes the harness down with it.**
  The transport writes to the child's stdin, and a body large enough to
  buffer completes asynchronously, so a bridge that exits meanwhile (no
  daemon, a failed preflight) raises `EPIPE` on that stream after the
  `try`/`catch` around the writes has returned. An `error` event with no
  listener is an uncaught exception and Node ends the process: the plugin's
  one promise, that Dibs being down costs the agent nothing, instead cost it
  the session. Both plugins listen now. Measured under Node, which is the
  runtime that dies; bun survives it, so a test driven there would have
  reported the fix verified against code that has the defect.

- **The successor-handover error stops prescribing work the daemon already
  does.** When `[roles.identity]` already names the agent standing under a
  pinned name, the withdrawal pass finds the predecessor by its fingerprint,
  takes the role and drops the pin, and a following pass grants the
  successor. The message still named four manual steps, so an operator
  following it demoted by hand an agent that was about to be demoted and
  edited two files a running daemon reads only at startup. The genuinely
  manual case still says how.


- **A remote that names a path no longer identifies a repository across
  machines.** `sameRepoIdentity` scopes the Git common directory to one host,
  because a path is evidence on one computer; the remote beside it was left
  machine-independent, and most remotes are. But a repository cloned from a
  directory has a remote like `/srv/source.git`, recorded as
  `file:/srv/source`, which is as machine-bound as the directory: two
  unrelated repositories cloned from the same path on two computers were read
  as one project, so an exclusive claim on one blocked claims and guarded
  writes in the other, in a checkout that machine has never seen. A shared
  ssh or https remote still identifies one project across machines, which is
  what cross-host coordination is built on, and root commits still decide it
  when they are known.


- **A pi agent that moved or recovered could be swept off the board as dead.**
  `register` stamps the board's `pid` with the bridge's own, because that
  process starts and ends with the session, and no later call re-stamps it.
  The extension kept only the newest shipper-starting bridge, so a relocating
  `update` or a `resume` killed the register bridge and left the board
  watching a dead pid: the next liveness sweep read `process_exited` for an
  agent that was working and released its claims. Every kept bridge now stays
  for the session, and the count is bounded by calls that happen at startup
  and on a recovery, not per turn.

- **Hook traffic is found by an id this machine used to answer to.** The
  writer resolved a host alias before filing an announcement and the reader
  asked with whatever it was handed, so after a machine adopted its Supgang
  identity a surviving bridge's hooks were filed under the new id and looked
  up under the old: a working guard reported `hooks_live: false`, which reads
  as "nothing is waking this agent" and sends an operator to install a plugin
  that is already installed. The key resolves its own aliases now, so no call
  site can ask the wrong question.


- **A revoked admin could be kept for good by another admin's stale pin.**
  `authorisedElsewhere` treats another declaration of the same credential as
  the same holder respelled, and asked only whether that other name had a pin
  at all. With `alpha → A` and `beta → B` both admin, an operator who changes
  the configuration to `beta → A` alone leaves beta holding a pin for B, and
  that stale pin answered for A: alpha's pin was dropped with no demotion,
  and removing every declaration afterwards revoked nothing, because the pin
  is what a withdrawal works through. The replacement pin must now be for the
  same fingerprint. Round fifty-five added the existence check and this is
  its other half.

- **The pi extension keeps a bridge for every call that starts an index
  shipper, and only when the call succeeded.** Two halves of the previous
  release candidate's fix. `shipIndexOnRegister` starts a shipper for
  `register`, for `resume`, and for an `update` that moves the agent, and the
  extension kept only the register one: a recovered or relocated agent lost
  its shipper, and worse, `resume` rotates the token, so the register bridge
  still held for its shipper went on shipping with a revoked one. And any
  reply at all used to qualify as success, so one refused re-registration
  killed the healthy bridge and replaced it with one that had registered
  nothing, taking the agent's shipper with it. **A refusal has two shapes**
  and the first cut of that fix caught only the rarer one: the daemon answers
  an ordinary tool failure with a perfectly good JSON-RPC response carrying
  `result.isError`, not with a transport error, and the fixture written for
  it produced only the transport error, so it passed against code that
  handled only that. Both shapes now fail the call, and both are driven.


- **The pi extension keeps the bridge that registered, so its index shipper
  runs.** The transport spawns `dibs mcp-stdio` per call and kills it at the
  answer, which is right for a guard and wrong for `register`: registering is
  what starts the bridge's index shipper, whose first look at the daemon's
  verdict is three seconds out, so pi registered successfully and shipped
  nothing, ever. A checkout the daemon cannot read itself, on a peer machine
  or behind macOS's file access, then had no semantic matching at all and
  nothing said so. opencode escapes this because it also runs the bridge as
  its MCP server; pi has no such process. That one child is now let go of
  rather than killed (stdout destroyed, handle unref'd), which lets pi exit
  at once and leaves the shipper running for the session: measured on bun
  1.3.14 and on node.

- **`internal/core` no longer reads a clock, and the guard that says so can
  see it.** `ReattachBySessionIDForTest` called `time.Now()` in a non-test
  file of the package: nothing replays through it, and it is exactly the
  precedent rule 1 exists to refuse. The caller hands it the clock now. The
  purity guard added a release-candidate earlier claimed to catch this and
  could not, because an import list cannot see a call and `time` is allowed
  on purpose; `TestCoreReadsNoClockAndNoRandomness` inspects the calls and
  was shown catching the real instance.


- **Round fifty-seven of the pre-release review: two findings.**
  - The paths inside a shipped commit are bounded like the file list.
    Round fifty-six bounded one and not the other, so an upload answered
    accepted and every declaration scored in that index was then refused
    at ingress as too large.
  - Eviction distinguishes machines. It compared working directories and
    a path names a different tree on each computer: after every agent of
    one machine left `/repo`, an agent on another machine at `/repo`
    kept the first machine's index alive, an index it is refused (an
    index serves the machine it was shipped from), while its own
    shipment for that root was refused because the slot was held. The
    index nobody could use survived and the one somebody needed never
    arrived.
- **Round fifty-six of the pre-release review: two findings, both in the
  fifty-fourth round's bound.**
  - Every string a shipped index puts into the ledger is bounded, not
    only the fingerprint: a file path of three megabytes produced an
    eighteen-megabyte ledger line through the predictions made from that
    index, which `dibs verify` cannot read back. Bounded at the upload
    and at ingress, like the fingerprint, and the predicted paths on a
    declaration with them.
  - A footprint's root is bounded like a PATH and not like a digest.
    Round fifty-four applied the three-hundred-byte digest limit to it,
    and `peerFootprints` fills those roots in by itself, so one indexed
    clone at a longer path made every declaration on the board fail with
    `E_TOO_LARGE`.
- **Round fifty-five of the pre-release review: two findings, both in the
  previous round's own fixes.**
  - A successor that never registers does not cost the predecessor its
    revocation record. Round fifty-four read the CONFIGURATION as
    authority to drop the old pin, and the configuration says what an
    operator intends rather than what happened: a successor nobody has
    registered left the predecessor holding the role with no pin
    recording it, so removing the declaration later revoked nothing. The
    replacement pin has to exist, which is the grant having succeeded.
  - The pi plugin stamps its repository on a resume, which the Go bridge
    already did. Without it a resume carries the new machine and no
    location, so the row keeps the directory it registered with: exactly
    the defect round fifty-four fixed, in the harness that did not get
    the fix.
- **Round fifty-four of the pre-release review: four findings.**
  - A resume records where the agent is NOW. It carried the machine and
    nothing else, so an agent that registered on a desktop and resumed
    on a laptop kept the desktop's directory and repository identity:
    its claims had no repository-relative key, two agents could hold one
    tracked file in clones of one project, and its wakes named a
    directory on the machine it had left. The bridge stamps its
    directory on every call now, which is how a call that carries no
    location of its own learns one.
  - An index fingerprint is bounded. It was checked for emptiness and
    not for size, and it travels onto every declaration scored in that
    index: a three-megabyte one escaped past eighteen megabytes in the
    ledger line and put the ledger beyond what `dibs verify` can read
    back, so the append succeeded and verification failed on that line
    and every later one. (The fingerprint only. A shipped FILE PATH
    reached the ledger the same way and is bounded in round fifty-six
    below, where the digest limit applied to a footprint's root is also
    corrected: a root is a path.)
  - Respelling a configured name does not revoke the role. Everything in
    the configuration is keyed by the name an operator typed, so
    changing `admin = ["Fleet Lead"]` to `admin = ["fleet-lead"]` with
    the same fingerprint is one agent under two spellings: the grant
    pass accepted the new one and the withdrawal pass took the role away
    through the old pin, leaving every admin call failing until the next
    tick.
  - The handover error says what the reconciler does. It told the
    operator the predecessor KEEPS its role until `dibs admin member`
    takes it and to edit the pin file; the role is withdrawn and the pin
    dropped automatically, and the pin file is read once at startup.
    The sibling of the message round fifty-three corrected.
- **Round fifty-three of the pre-release review: four findings.**
  - The mailbox census counts what an adoption would move. It walked
    every retained message addressed to the id, which is a third answer
    to "what is in this mailbox": a notify the agent had acknowledged was
    counted, so a coordinator deciding "recover or prune" was told there
    was mail and the adoption it then approved answered
    `E_NOTHING_TO_ADOPT`.
  - `dibs doctor` recommends a wake configuration that can exist. The
    coverage key carries the reason an agent is uncovered, and the advice
    stripped two of those decorations and not the third, so it printed
    `[wake.exec."codex (on review-laptop)"]`: a harness no agent runs.
    The two cases that produce that key got no usable advice at all.
  - Withdrawing a role says it was withdrawn. Removing an agent's
    `[roles.identity]` entry demotes it now, and the messages around that
    still described the behaviour from before: one told the operator to
    withdraw it by hand, the other offered to paste back the entry they
    had deliberately deleted. Following either undoes the revocation.
  - The changelog's account of a forged `SessionStart` matches
    SECURITY.md: one forgery defers a wake by a cooldown, and a caller
    that repeats it defers indefinitely, which the entry above claimed a
    bound for.
- **Round fifty-two of the pre-release review: three findings.**
  - A bridge asks the daemon about its index with the spelling it
    shipped. The upload makes the root portable and the daemon keys its
    status by that, while the bridge asked with the native one: on
    Windows the two never matched, so it mined and uploaded the whole
    repository every five minutes for a shipment already held, and the
    fingerprint check discarded the result after the work and the
    transfer.
  - `dibs doctor` reports trees on other machines whatever the matching
    phase. The report lived inside the `ready` branch, and the shipped
    default is suggest-only, which is also the phase a supplied index
    installs as: the configuration where remote trees are most likely
    was the one the report never ran in.
  - A shipped index serves the subdirectories of the tree it was shipped
    for. A remote entry is a directory an agent is IN and a shipment
    names the repository ROOT, so doctor told the operator that a
    working bridge had never shipped and sent them to troubleshoot it.
- **Round fifty-one of the pre-release review: two findings.**
  - Every answer about this machine's identity competes for one file.
    The Supgang branch wrote `supgang_node_id` and the minting branch
    exclusively created `host_id`, so two bridges could each look, see
    nothing, and then each succeed at a different name: two identities
    on one computer, held for the life of both processes, with
    host-scoped claims no longer colliding between its own agents.
    Exclusivity is only exclusivity when everybody competes for the same
    name, which is the fourth and, structurally, the last shape of this
    race.
  - The status that says a tree has a supplied index moves with the
    index. `NoteSuppliedIndexFrom` and the match status ran after the
    claim lock was released, so an eviction in between removed the
    scorer and left the status describing one: the shipment answered
    accepted, matching was gone, and the bridge then skipped re-shipping
    because the status said an index was installed. Nothing recovered
    from that until a restart.
- **Round fifty of the pre-release review: one finding.** A Supgang
  answer that arrives after this machine has already published an
  identity is recorded as PENDING, and nothing that is serving reads it.
  Round forty-five stopped the bridge that got the late answer from using
  it, and still wrote it down as this machine's identity: the next
  process to start read that file first and answered with the fleet id
  while the two already running answered with the minted one. One
  computer, three bridges, two names, and a hub that reads its agents as
  two machines. The daemon promotes the pending identity at its next
  start, which is where the transition belongs and where the rows
  registered under the old id are renamed with it.
- **Round forty-nine of the pre-release review: two findings.**
  - A shipped index is not calibrated against this machine's disk.
    Calibration samples commits and builds a held-out index by running
    git in the root, and a shipped index's root is a path on the
    SHIPPER's machine: if an unrelated checkout sat there, the threshold
    deciding which suggestions an agent sees was measured on somebody
    else's history, and if nothing sat there this retried the access the
    shipment exists to work around. Such an index keeps the configured
    threshold, unmeasured, which is the honest answer when there is
    nothing here to measure.
  - `dibs doctor` counts a host bridge only for another machine's
    agents. The daemon refuses that route for a local agent outright, so
    a bridge attached for this host advertising a harness made doctor
    report a local agent as reachable through a wake that has nowhere to
    go. The mirror of round thirteen's finding, from the other side.
- **Round forty-eight of the pre-release review: two findings.**
  - A force_release that names a holder is not folded by the caller's
    platform either. The path belongs to the holder's machine, and the
    fold asked only whether the CALLER was remote: a coordinator on a
    Windows hub releasing a unix agent's `/work/a\b` had it folded to
    `/work/a/b` and released that instead, reporting success while the
    claim it was asked about stayed held.
  - A lifecycle announcement from a bridge that predates the identity
    adoption is recognised as this machine's, which the hook poll already
    did and this did not: the announcement was filed under a machine no
    row is on, `hook_blocked` answered ok with an empty parent, and the
    next poll made a second record for one session.
- **Round forty-seven of the pre-release review: three findings, each
  the previous round's fix missing a sibling.** The rule was right in one
  place and absent in the next one along, three times over, so each is
  now applied where the decision is made rather than where it was
  reported.
  - Every entry point that folds a path separator asks whose machine the
    path came from (`foldFor`): the write guard and the lifecycle hooks
    were still folding unconditionally, so a Windows hub answered `allow`
    for a unix agent's `/work/a\b` while the claim on it stood.
  - The pi plugin leaves another agent's `force_release` path as the
    board spells it, which the bridge and the hub already did.
  - The report printed after `codex-hooks --trust` writes asks whether
    the hooks are ON as well as trusted, which every other report already
    did: trusting one hook while the Stop hook was switched off announced
    a delivery that does not happen.
- **Round forty-six of the pre-release review: three findings.**
  - A Windows hub folds separators for its OWN callers only. The daemon's
    platform says what a separator means here and nothing about the
    machine an op came from, so a Windows hub rewrote a unix member's
    `/work/a\b`, one file whose name contains a backslash, into
    `/work/a/b`, which is another: two resources merged before anything
    was ledgered. A remote bridge already sends its own machine's paths
    portably, so there was nothing to fold for it. (The op path only.
    The lifecycle hooks and the write guard went on folding
    unconditionally until round forty-seven below, so the guard could
    still answer `allow` for a file a remote agent held.)
  - A path named on another agent's behalf is not resolved locally.
    `force_release` with an `agent` quotes the path the board shows,
    which is the holder's spelling on the holder's machine; the bridge
    and the hub both resolved it against the caller's filesystem, so a
    macOS coordinator releasing a Linux agent's `/tmp/repo/file.go` asked
    for `/private/tmp/repo/file.go`, was told there was no such claim,
    and left the real one in place. (In the bridge and the hub. The pi
    plugin kept resolving it until round forty-seven below.)
  - A Codex hook that is switched off is not reported as delivering mail.
    `hooks/list` reports trust and enablement separately and lists
    disabled hooks too; `dibs codex-hooks` and `dibs doctor` read only
    the first, so both said mail arrived at every lifecycle boundary for
    a hook a person had turned off in the Codex TUI. (Every report but
    the one printed after `--trust` writes, which round forty-seven
    below fixes.)
- **Round forty-five of the pre-release review: two findings.**
  - A Supgang lookup that succeeds does not overrule an identity another
    process here published while it ran. Round forty closed the direction
    where this process waits and mints; a bridge whose lookup failed fast
    could still publish a minted id first and leave the one whose lookup
    succeeded answering with the fleet id for its whole life, which is one
    computer with two identities and a hub that reads them as two. The
    published file decides for this boot, and the fleet identity is
    adopted at the next start, where nothing is racing. (It was written
    down as this machine's identity, which the NEXT process to start then
    read as current: round fifty below records it as pending instead.)
  - A portable path is contained with the portable separator. `underDir`
    made both operands portable and then joined them with
    `filepath.Separator`, so on a Windows hub `C:/work/repo/pkg` was not
    beneath `C:/work/repo`: an index shipped from a subdirectory was
    answered 403, and eviction did not count an agent in one as keeping
    the index alive. Invisible on a unix host, where the two separators
    are the same character.
- **Round forty-four of the pre-release review: three findings.**
  - The hub cleans a remote caller's path and a shipped index's root the
    portable way, so a UNC share survives the one layer that still
    collapsed it. `filepath.Clean` on a unix hub dropped a slash at the
    tool entry point and at the upload, which put every claim outside the
    checkout its own registration recorded and installed a shipped index
    under a root its agent is not in: the upload answered `accepted` and
    the scorer then refused the index.
  - `force_release` releases the claim it was asked for. It matched on the
    path alone, and two agents holding `/workspace/repo/file.go` on two
    machines is not a collision but two real claims, so a coordinator
    unsticking one machine could take the other's protection off and leave
    the one it meant in place. It takes an `agent` now, and an ambiguous
    call is refused at ingress with both holders named rather than
    guessed. Refused at ingress and not in the fold, because an op that was
    accepted when it was written must not be refused on replay.
- **Round forty-three of the pre-release review: three findings.**
  - The space matching opens carries the provenance of the index that
    predicted its footprint. A declaration is predicted twice, and the
    second one relabelled the fresh footprint with the fingerprint of
    the index that answered while leaving the supplied-or-not bit as the
    first recorded it: an index replaced by a shipped one in between
    produced a footprint built from untrusted data and stored as the
    daemon's own, which is the one bit that stops a shipped index
    deciding membership. The backfill's provenance comes from the same
    pick now too.
  - The pi plugin resolves the same path arguments the bridge does. Its
    own list was missing the directories an agent declares and the cwd
    it registers, so an agent on pi sent them as typed and the daemon
    compared them against spellings it had resolved. A test now fails if
    either side gains an argument the other lacks.
  - A UNC checkout keeps both leading slashes IN THE FOLD AND IN
    `paths.Portable`. `path.Clean` collapses them, and
    `//server/share/repo` is a share on another machine while
    `/server/share/repo` is a local directory: a root recorded as one
    with claims cleaned to the other is a prefix that never matches, so
    no claim inside that checkout had a repository-relative key and two
    hosts could hold one tracked file exclusively. (The hub's own entry
    points still cleaned the other way and undid it before the fold ever
    saw the path; round forty-four below closes that, and this entry said
    "fixed" when half of the path was.)
- **Round forty-two of the pre-release review: four findings.**
  - Two declarations are compared only inside a coordinate system both
    carry, which is what SPEC-CHANNELS.md §4 requires. The home-to-home
    comparison stayed as an unconditional floor, so a pair that is
    disjoint inside every index they actually share still scored on one
    filename both histories happen to contain, and at
    `auto_join = "always"` that puts an agent into a space on unrelated
    work. A slot that names no index keeps the old comparison, which is
    the only one it can take part in.
  - The opencode and pi plugins spell a Windows path the way the bridge
    does. They sent `C:\repo\file.go` where the same agent's
    registration had recorded `C:/repo`, so on a unix hub the claim was
    not inside the checkout it names and an exclusive claim protected
    nothing. One table now runs through all three implementations.
  - The directories an agent declares are canonicalised like every other
    path it sends. `declare` was not in the table at all, so the
    strongest signal an agent gives about where it is writing could not
    be made relative to its own root. (In the Go bridge. The pi plugin
    kept its own list and was missed; round forty-three below fixes that
    and makes the two lists agree.)
  - A shipment names its root the way the registration did. The hub
    learned the portable spelling last round and the bridge went on
    sending the native one, so a Windows checkout was answered 403 on
    every upload.
- **The repository index ceiling is no longer a lifetime count.** (#40) A
  tree stayed indexed after the last agent in it was terminal, so a
  long-running fleet used up the sixteen slots and silently stopped
  indexing anything new: matching went off for every project opened after
  that, with nothing said. Idle indexes are evicted against the board's own
  account of who is still here, and the slot comes back. Thanks to @qtjg
  (#43), whose eviction key (no remaining non-terminal agent in the tree) is
  the one everything built on it since depends on.

- **Round forty-one of the pre-release review: two findings.**
  - An agent that resumes on another machine takes the thread there. The
    fold's drop asks which machine the take is from and read it off the
    row, which on a resume still says where that agent was last time:
    the ingress authorised the take on the new machine and the fold then
    skipped that machine's holder as another computer's, leaving two rows
    holding one thread.
  - A Windows bridge sends its checkout spelled the way it sends its
    paths. The claim arguments were made portable and the repository
    metadata beside them was not, so the hub saw a claim at
    `C:/work/repo/file.go` against a root at `C:\work\repo`: the root
    is no longer a prefix, the claim records an empty repository-relative
    path, and conflicts between two clones of one project stop being
    seen.
- **Round forty of the pre-release review: three findings.**
  - A first start on a fleet member cannot leave one computer with two
    identities. Two bridges starting together against a fresh directory
    both find nothing recorded; if one Supgang lookup answers and the
    other times out, the loser used to mint a random id and keep it for
    its life, which the exclusive publication of `host_id` does not
    prevent because the two take different branches. A process refused an
    answer, on a machine where Supgang exists, now waits briefly for the
    answer another process got, and the minting branch never writes over
    an identity recorded meanwhile.
  - A session takeover on one machine leaves the other machine's binding
    alone. The ingress picks the holder that yields on the caller's
    machine; the fold's drop visited every row and took the id from any
    that was not active, so a register on one machine stripped a dormant
    holder of the same synthetic id on another, and that machine's hooks
    and guard resolved to nobody.
  - An index shipped from a Windows checkout is accepted BY THE HUB. The
    upload asked for a leading slash, so `C:/work/repo` was refused as
    relative while a claim from the same bridge was not. The rule about
    what is absolute for whoever wrote it now lives in one place. (The
    other half of that path, the bridge sending the native spelling, was
    still broken here and is fixed in round forty-two below: this entry
    read as though Windows shipments worked, and they did not.)
- **Round thirty-nine of the pre-release review: one finding.** The
  identity migration carries the repository snapshot a claim holds, not
  just the claim's own host. Two linked worktrees of one checkout are
  recognised as one tree by the git common directory they share, and that
  evidence counts only between snapshots that speak for the same machine:
  a claim taken before an adoption read as another computer's tree
  afterwards, so a conflicting write from the other worktree of the same
  checkout stopped colliding with it. The paths differ there, which is
  why nothing else caught it.
- **Round thirty-eight of the pre-release review: three findings.**
  - Every path that adopts a host identity keeps this computer's old ids
    recognisable. The aliases and the rename were given to the branch
    where Supgang answers; the two fallback branches adopt the same fleet
    id out of the remembered file and had neither, so a daemon starting
    while Supgang was down or uninstalled read the agents of a bridge that
    predates the migration as another machine's, and two of them could
    hold one path exclusively.
  - A footprint carries the provenance of the index that predicted it.
    Prediction runs off the match lock and the supplied-or-not bit was
    read afterwards, by repository path, from the index map as it stood
    then: an eviction during the prediction turned a footprint built from
    an index an agent shipped into one recorded as the daemon's own, and
    auto-join reads exactly that bit. The provenance now comes back with
    the scorer that answered.
  - `open_space` from a tree this daemon has no index for predicts
    nothing, instead of reaching for whichever project it does hold. A nil
    scorer meant both "the opener said nothing about where it is", which
    is what the daemon's own index is for, and "this agent's tree has no
    index the rules allow here"; the second seeded a space with another
    repository's files as overlap evidence.
- **Round thirty-seven of the pre-release review: two findings, and a race
  the gate caught.**
  - The startup host migration reaches the fold. `host_renamed` is the
    daemon acting as itself, so it is submitted with no token, and it was
    not on the engine's list of operations that carry none: authentication
    refused every one before `Apply` saw it, and the migration the previous
    round describes ran nowhere but in a test that called the fold
    directly. Rows registered before an adoption kept the old id, which is
    the split claim that round was fixing. The op is on the list, refused
    if it arrives with an agent's token like every other system op, and the
    regression test goes through the engine.
  - An index is published under the same hold of the lock that checks the
    tree is still its own. The previous round checked the claim and then
    installed; eviction deletes the bookkeeping and removes the scorer
    under that lock precisely so the half-done state is never observed, and
    a build finishing between the two steps reinstalled an orphan index
    over the top and answered the shipper "accepted". Both publication
    paths, the daemon's own build and an agent-supplied index, now move the
    claim, the index and the fingerprint together.
  - A background notifier probe is claimed before it is started. The
    background start was `go linuxProbe()`, and the flag that says a probe
    is in flight was set inside the new goroutine: between the two, a
    caller that waits for the probe to finish sees nothing running and
    returns. CI's race detector reported the consequence as a write racing
    a read from a goroutine belonging to a test that had already returned.
- **Round thirty-six of the pre-release review: four findings.**
  - A machine that adopts its fleet identity renames the rows and claims
    it already holds, through a ledgered `host_renamed` op (both ids on
    the op, so replay makes the same substitution). Recognising the old
    id at ingress fixed what arrived; the board still held rows
    registered under it, and the fold compares those strings, so an agent
    from either side of the adoption could take an exclusive claim on the
    same path and neither was a collision.
  - Lifecycle hooks and the write guard recognise an id this machine used
    to answer to: a surviving bridge's registration was canonicalised
    while its hooks resolved to nobody, so its mail nudges vanished and
    the guard took its unidentified-session path.
  - A failed index build releases the claim it actually holds. `bringUp`
    moves the claim onto the root git resolves, and the release used the
    key the build started with, so a tree whose first build failed stayed
    reserved until an eviction or a restart.
  - A Unix hub accepts a Windows caller's absolute path (`C:/work/...`, a
    UNC share): it asked its own `filepath.IsAbs`, so `claim` and
    `release` from a Windows bridge were refused as relative before the
    remote-path handling that exists for those callers could run.
- **Round thirty-five of the pre-release review: three findings.**
  - A machine that adopts its Supgang identity still recognises the id it
    used to answer to. The transition is real and one-way, and a machine
    that ran Dibs before joining the fleet has rows, claims and
    long-lived bridges carrying the id it minted: renaming it under all of
    them made its own agents read as remote and let two of them take an
    exclusive claim on one path. The previous ids are recognised at
    ingress and replaced with the current one, so the ledger records one
    machine; nothing is ever stamped with an alias.
  - The Linux notification retry is reachable from the path the daemon
    takes. The previous round put it in `linuxProbe`, and `Available()`
    asks `linuxProbeCached`: the fix was reachable from its own test and
    from nothing else.
  - An index build publishes only under the claim it took, and the claim
    follows the root git resolves (the pre-warm claims the path the
    operator typed; `/var` and `/private/var` are two keys for one tree).
    Mining takes minutes, and a root evicted (or claimed again) meanwhile
    left the finished build installing an index the repository ceiling
    did not know about, over the top of whatever had replaced it. The
    same guard covers a supplied index, whose scorer is built outside the
    lock.
- **Round thirty-four of the pre-release review: two findings.**
  - The Supgang retry remembers nothing. Remembering is how every other
    process on a machine learns its identity, and a running daemon cannot
    change its own: writing the new id from the retry handed it to the
    next bridge to start while that daemon and every older bridge still
    answered with the other, which is the split the whole sequence exists
    to prevent. The daemon that ADOPTS an identity is the one that
    remembers it, at startup; the retry says a restart would pick it up.
  - A failed Linux notification probe is measured again after half a
    minute. It was cached for the life of the process, so a notification
    daemon that was restarting, or a deadline missed under load, switched
    this daemon's notifications off until somebody restarted it, while a
    fresh `dibs doctor` reported them healthy. A working host is not
    re-probed: the send itself reports a failure.
- **Round thirty-three of the pre-release review: two findings.**
  - A machine's identity is the fact its data directory records, and
    Supgang seeds it rather than overriding it. Asking Supgang first was
    the identity split from the other side: the first bridge started after
    Supgang became available answered with the fleet id while every older
    bridge, and the running daemon, still answered with the minted one, so
    two agents on one computer could each take an exclusive claim on the
    same path outside a checkout. A machine joining the fleet adopts its
    fleet identity when the daemon there next starts, which is also when
    it is remembered for everything else.
  - The footprint backfill never predicts with an index an agent shipped.
    It invented a footprint for a space that had none, out of untrusted
    data, and cached it with no provenance, so the next local agent whose
    work overlapped that invention was joined automatically: SECURITY.md's
    promise about supplied indexes, broken through a cache. A space with
    no footprint of its own is matched on its refs and dirs, as it was
    before the backfill existed.
- **Round thirty-two of the pre-release review: two findings.**
  - `open_space` predicts the new space's footprint in the OPENER's index
    rather than whichever tree was indexed first, and records whether that
    index was one an agent shipped. It recorded neither, so a space opened
    by hand could carry a footprint built from untrusted data with no
    provenance, and the next local agent whose work overlapped it was
    joined automatically on the strength of it: SECURITY.md's "a supplied
    index decides no membership", through the one door that did not ask.
  - A declared role is withdrawn when its `[roles.identity]` entry is
    DELETED, not only when the name leaves `[roles]` or the fingerprint
    changes. A declared name with no fingerprint can never be granted, so
    a config that has lost it authorises nobody; the reconciler read the
    missing entry as "unchanged" and left an admin in place that the same
    config could not have granted. `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` says so.
- **Round thirty-one of the pre-release review: one finding.** Supgang
  UNINSTALLED is a failed lookup like any other: the daemon returned early
  and served under its ledger id while every bridge here kept the
  remembered Supgang one, so it read its own agents as remote and skipped
  its own wake commands for them. It keeps the identity this computer is
  already known by, and does not retry, because nothing is coming.
- **Round thirty of the pre-release review: four findings, all in the
  identification retry the previous round added.**
  - A daemon's identity is settled before it serves and never changes
    while it does. The retry called the setter from its goroutine: the
    identity decides which agents are on this machine, so changing it
    under a board that already holds claims split it (rows registered
    before and after read as two computers, and both could take one path
    exclusively), and the setter writes a field the request path reads,
    which is a data race. The retry now only remembers the answer, so the
    next start is right, and says that a restart would pick it up.
  - It also treated "the remembered id is in use" as "identified", so the
    case it was added for retried nothing at all.
  - The pi extension's fallback no longer answers with the saved address
    when the binary could not be asked: that read as an answer and hid the
    origin a bridge had published, so with no `dibs` on PATH it kept
    dialling a hub that had moved.
- **Round twenty-nine of the pre-release review: two findings, both the
  other half of the previous round's.**
  - The DAEMON keeps the identity this computer is known by when Supgang
    does not answer, as the bridge now does, and retries every minute
    until it does. It kept the board's own node id while every bridge here
    carried the Supgang one, so the fold read this machine's own agents as
    remote: the daemon refused its own local wake commands for them and no
    host bridge existed to take over. Both halves read one remembered file
    (`supgang_node_id`), through one helper.
  - The pi extension asks `dibs identity` first and falls back to the
    origin a bridge published, not the other way round: pi runs without a
    bridge, so a file a previous one left could outlive the address in it
    and pinned every call to a hub that had moved.
- **Round twenty-eight of the pre-release review: two findings.**
  - A machine known by its Supgang node id keeps it when a lookup fails.
    The bridge fell through to the id it mints in the data directory on ANY
    error (a timeout, a restarting service, a process that started while
    Supgang was initialising) and held it for its life while its
    neighbours held the Supgang one; the fold reads two ids as two
    machines, so two agents on one computer each took an exclusive claim on
    the same path outside a checkout and the guard allowed both writes. The
    first successful answer is remembered beside the secret and stands in.
  - A prediction and the fingerprint it is recorded under come from one
    lookup under one lock, and matching labels its fresh prediction with
    the index that produced it: read separately, a shipment landing in
    between recorded one index's files under another's fingerprint, and two
    coordinate systems then compared as one.
- **Round twenty-seven of the pre-release review: three findings, each in
  the previous two rounds' own code.**
  - Both plugins spell a path beneath a top-level directory that does not
    exist yet the way it was written: the resolver took the unresolved tail
    by slicing off the parent's length, and under `/` that ate the first
    letter of the name, so the guard asked about a path nobody was writing
    while the bridge had recorded the claim correctly.
  - The plugins re-read where the hub is rather than keeping the first
    answer: the bridge republishes when the hub moves and when it restarts,
    and a plugin that read the origin once went on dialling an address the
    bridge had already left. Re-read per call, cached for a second; pi asks
    the binary again at most once a minute.
  - The engine tests that arrange a state the tools cannot reach (a
    coordinator role, a dormant human, an inherited mailbox) do it on the
    engine's own loop rather than touching `core.State` beside it: sending
    to the human spawns a handler that registers the person's row, and the
    Linux runner's race detector caught the unsynchronised read next to it.
  - `dibs doctor` on a joined machine counts the agents here that have
    never supplied a harness thread instead of skipping them: no route can
    wake those whatever the machine configures, and skipping them let the
    check report that the bridge "covers every wakeable agent recorded
    here" about a machine whose only agent could not be woken.
- **Round twenty-six of the pre-release review: four findings.**
  - An index is fingerprinted by the files it scores over as well as the
    history behind it, through one function the daemon and a shipper both
    use. Two checkouts at one commit with a staged rename in one shared a
    history fingerprint, so the engine called them one coordinate system
    and never scored each declaration in the other's index: two agents on
    the same file compared as strangers, and a shipped payload with a
    changed file list was "already installed".
  - The bridge's upgrade handoff carries every tree it ships an index for,
    with the credential; an upgraded bridge shipped nothing until the agent
    happened to register, resume or move, and a daemon restarted meanwhile
    held no index for its tree.
  - Both plugins dial the hub where it is now: the bridge publishes the
    origin it dialled (`resolved_origin`, after any `DIBS_BOARD_PEER`
    resolution) and the opencode plugin reads it; `dibs identity` reports
    it and the pi extension takes it. Both derived their endpoint from the
    saved `DIBS_ADDR` and kept dialling a hub that had moved.
  - A changelog entry from earlier in this cycle said the Linux build was
    compiled and not run; the CI has run it since, and the entry says so.
- **Round twenty-five of the pre-release review: two findings.**
  - On Linux a question with no choices no longer offers "Write answer…":
    notify-send carries buttons and no text field, and the press dismissed
    the notification, opened nothing, recorded nothing and said nothing
    (the prompt's error was swallowed). The button there is "Where to
    answer…", and pressing it says: the board, `dibs web` opens it, the
    question stays open.
  - `dibs doctor` on a machine joined to a hub elsewhere compares the
    harnesses its `dibs.toml` has commands for with the ones the attached
    host bridge ADVERTISED when it started, and with the agents recorded
    here: a bridge started before an entry was added is told to restart,
    and an agent on a harness nothing here can start is named. It counted
    commands and asked whether a bridge was attached.
- **Round twenty-four of the pre-release review: two findings, both in the
  pi extension.**
  - Every path argument goes out as the bridge spells it (its `pathArgs`
    table: claim, release, force_release, guard_path, the hooks' cwd), not
    only a registration's directory; a hub does not resolve a remote
    caller's paths, so a claim on `/tmp/repo/pkg/x.go` from an agent
    registered at `/private/tmp/repo` had no repository-relative key.
  - Its transport bounds elapsed time, not socket idleness: a daemon that
    kept trickling bytes was never cut off, and the poll in front of the
    user's turn waited on it indefinitely.
- **Round twenty-three of the pre-release review: three findings.**
  - The opencode plugin keeps only the host the bridge published; a hook
    that ran before the bridge had published cached "" (or the daemon's
    file) for the life of the process, and through an ssh forward an empty
    assertion is the hub's identity, so every later guard resolved nobody.
  - The pi extension describes the checkout an `update` names when it
    moves the agent, spelled as the bridge would; it stamped the original
    checkout's identity beside the new directory.
  - The Gemini recipe and README say what a NEW session gets: its id is
    unbound until the agent's first `check_in` in it, whose `waiting` line
    carries the digest; a resumed session opens with it. They promised the
    digest at the start of a second session, which the daemon refuses by
    design (a supplied id that matches nothing is not guessed at).
- **Round twenty-two of the pre-release review: three findings.**
  - The pi extension asks `dibs identity` (new, plumbing) what this machine
    and checkout are, once per session, instead of carrying a TypeScript
    copy of the bridge's answers that lacked the next one every round: it
    sent no repository identity, so a remote pi agent registered with no
    checkout and two clones of one repository on two machines were both
    granted an exclusive claim on the same tracked file; and from a fresh
    joined directory it found no host at all, since it read only files a
    bridge writes. The binary mints the host as the bridge would and reads
    the checkout from Git; `DIBS_BIN` names it off `PATH`.
  - `dibs hook-poll` and the other command hooks spell their path
    arguments as the bridge does (symlinks resolved), so a hook announcing
    `/tmp/repo` matches a registration recorded as `/private/tmp/repo` on
    a hub that does not resolve a remote caller's paths.
- **Round twenty-one of the pre-release review: three findings.**
  - A session alias is claimed from the holder on the CALLER's machine.
    The claim looked the holder up across the whole board and a dormant
    holder yields, so a register on machine B stating the synthetic
    `host-12345` took that binding from a dormant agent on machine A, whose
    hooks and guard then resolved to nobody.
  - Session evidence of one agent under two names (a shared session id, a
    registration provenance the other holds) speaks for one machine only;
    two bridges on two machines that shared a pid read as one agent, and a
    stranded mailbox could not be adopted onto the genuinely separate one.
    A proven parent still counts across machines.
  - The pi extension sends `_meta com.dibs/host` on every tool call, read
    the way the bridge and the opencode plugin read it; a call without one
    from another machine registered an agent with no machine, and its host
    bridge was never chosen for a wake.
- **Round twenty of the pre-release review: three findings.**
  - The fields this cycle added to a registration are bounded at admission
    like the rest: `host_id`, `repo_root`, the session alias and
    `registered_from`. A caller-supplied 17 MiB host id passed, was
    ledgered, and then failed the ledger reader's line cap, so the daemon
    could not replay its own history.
  - The pi extension posts through Node's own HTTP client rather than
    `fetch`: pi runs under Node, whose `fetch` ignores a CA, so the
    round-nineteen trust did nothing there and a joined HTTPS board still
    installed no tools. Verified under both node and bun.
  - Both plugins trust the daemon's own CA (`tls-ca.pem`) as well as the
    recorded peers, as the bridge does, with the runtime's roots kept; a
    hub's own plugin refused the daemon its bridge accepted.
- **Round nineteen of the pre-release review: four findings.**
  - A harness whose bridge names the session `host-<ppid>` and whose hooks
    name it by UUID (Gemini CLI) is one session. The bridge's synthetic id
    arrived as a session alias on every call and switched the directory
    inference off, so the UUID the hooks announced was never bound and
    every `dibs hook-poll` resolved to nobody while reporting success. An
    alias that is not a thread and that the row already holds leaves the
    inference on.
  - The opencode plugin spells paths as the daemon compares them (symlinks
    resolved, a not-yet-existing file's deepest real ancestor), as the
    bridge does; a hub does not resolve a remote caller's paths, so an
    exclusive claim stored as `/private/tmp/x` did not cover an edit sent
    as `/tmp/x/new.go`.
  - The opencode and pi plugins keep the scheme `DIBS_ADDR` carries and
    check an `https://` board's certificate against the store `dibs trust`
    recorded (the pi half of that only became true in round twenty); they
    prefixed `http://` to a joined board's origin and every hook failed
    silently while the bridge beside it connected. The
    opencode README's MCP entry is the stdio bridge, which the plugin's
    session pairing depends on, not a `remote` URL.
  - `dibs configure` no longer offers a Remap name for a board off
    loopback: the name serves plain HTTP and the board's session cookie is
    TLS-only, so it reached a board the operator could not unlock through
    it. The wizard says so and where to reach the board instead.
- **Round eighteen of the pre-release review: four findings.**
  - Reattach by session id is scoped to the caller's machine. `host-<ppid>`
    repeats across computers and people name agents by role, so a second
    machine's plain `register` as "reviewer" under host-12345 recovered the
    first machine's row: token rotated out from under it, mailbox taken. A
    row or an op that recorded no host keeps the old answer, and no shipped
    register carries one.
  - Lifecycle records (`hook_session`, `hook_blocked`, `hook_poll`) are
    keyed by machine as well as session id, so two machines' children with
    one id are two records; they merged into one, the second keeping the
    first's parent and moving its progress counter.
  - The Codex stanza `dibs mcp-config` prints is built from the same env
    the JSON block is, so a hub named as a Supgang peer reaches
    `~/.codex/config.toml` with `DIBS_BOARD_PEER` as it did `.mcp.json`;
    without it that bridge was fixed to the printed address.
  - `dibs hook-poll`, `dibs hook`, `await`, `watch` and `monitor` dial the
    hub where Supgang says it is now, as the bridge does, resolved once per
    process; they dialled the saved address and timed out after the hub
    moved.
- **Round seventeen of the pre-release review: four findings.**
  - Every hook that reaches the daemon without the stdio bridge says which
    machine it is on: `dibs hook-poll` and the other hook subcommands, and
    the opencode plugin, now send `_meta com.dibs/host` the way the bridge
    does. A call without it that arrives on loopback is stamped as the
    daemon's own machine, so through the documented `ssh -L` forward a
    remote agent's guard resolved to nobody and its edit went ahead past an
    exclusive claim. The bridge publishes the host it resolved as
    `resolved_host_id` beside the secret and the plugin reads that, so the
    two halves of one machine agree even where the bridge's answer came
    from Supgang, which the plugin cannot ask.
  - The named link (`http://<name>/?bt=…`) is printed only for a board
    served over plain HTTP. Remap serves a name over HTTP and the daemon's
    session cookie is TLS-only when its own leg is, so for an HTTPS board
    the link spent the single-use token on a cookie the browser discarded.
    `dibs web` says why the name is withheld; `dibs doctor` warns.
  - The delivery note for an agent on another machine asks whether it has a
    thread id to resume, as the local note does: a bridge attached there is
    not a route without one, and the sender was told a wake was coming.
  - The harness survey no longer says Pi "speaks 2025-11-25": it has no MCP
    client, and an SDK in a lockfile is not one.
- **Round sixteen of the pre-release review: three findings.**
  - A resume retried after the agent was archived is a resume, not a
    replay. The idempotent retry matched on the activation, which archival
    leaves alone, and handed back the token archival had cleared with
    `resumed: true` and the row still archived; the next call failed
    `E_BAD_TOKEN` and named the recovery that had just reported success.
    The cached answer is returned only while the row still holds that
    token.
  - `hook_session` and `hook_blocked` announce a session with the machine
    it came from, as `hook_poll` already did; an announcement without one
    was matched on the directory alone, so the cross-machine inheritance
    closed in round fifteen was still open through those two calls.
  - The bridge's `_meta com.dibs/repo` on a register describes the checkout
    the register names AFTER the sidecar has filled it in, not the bridge's
    own process directory; a remote hub recorded the session's directory
    beside another checkout's identity, or none, and claims made there
    carried the wrong repository-relative key.
- **Round fifteen of the pre-release review: three findings.**
  - A shipped footprint decides no membership after its declaration is
    gone either. `undeclare` removed the slot that carried the provenance
    and left the footprint merged into the space; with no live declaration
    to compare, the score fell back to that footprint and the local agent
    was joined on it. A space now records that some of its footprint was
    supplied, and the fallback carries that.
  - The host-scoped session lookup (a hook or guard from a known machine)
    keeps every preference the plain one has: stated over guessed, active,
    held first. It took whichever holder map iteration reached, so two
    agents through one bridge on one machine resolved to either per call,
    and a guard attributed to the claim holder allowed the sibling's edit.
  - A session announced from another machine is not inherited by directory.
    The announcement dropped the host the transport established, so an
    agent registering on machine A at a path a session had announced from
    on machine B was handed B's thread; its guard then answered for A's
    agent and its wake resumed a thread that exists only on B.
- **Round fourteen of the pre-release review: two findings, both edges of
  round thirteen.**
  - The repository question is answered from the two ROWS' recorded
    identities in the fold (host-aware), not from a lens keyed by path: two
    machines sharing `/workspace/repo` with different projects were read as
    one repository, and `pr:42` in both as a shared objective.
  - A declaration records whether its footprint came from an index an agent
    shipped (`index_supplied`, a frozen tag), so the no-membership rule
    holds after the cache has forgotten the fingerprint (a replaced or
    evicted shipment); and a shipped payload must carry a fingerprint.
- **Round thirteen of the pre-release review: four findings.**
  - A supplied index decides no membership on EITHER side of a comparison:
    a local agent matching a remote peer's shipped footprint was joined to
    the peer's space under `auto_join = "always"`, because only the
    declaring side's index was checked. Evidence now records which index
    produced the peer's footprint and a shipped one only ever suggests.
  - Cross-machine matching reads the repository identity the board
    recorded at registration (host-aware) instead of asking Git here about
    directories on another machine; two clones of one project on two
    machines declaring `pr:42` are matched as one repository, two different
    projects at nested paths are not. A remote agent with no index here is
    matched on its refs, dirs and holds instead of not at all (a local agent
    with no index keeps the "matching is off" answer), and the hub's own
    tree is no longer read as evidence that it works "somewhere else".
  - Eviction removes an index's scorer under the same lock as its
    bookkeeping; a discovery or shipment in the gap between the two could
    install a replacement the removal then deleted.
  - Remote unix paths keep their backslashes: the hub folded `\` to `/` in
    every path a remote bridge sent, turning a unix name with a backslash
    into a different path; a bridge on a Windows machine now spells its own
    paths with `/` before sending, and the hub cleans without folding.
- **Round twelve of the pre-release review: four findings, all reproduced
  by the reviewer.**
  - A bridge's session id (`host-<ppid>`) repeats across machines, and hook
    and guard lookups matched on it alone: beta's guard resolved to alpha on
    another machine and allowed a write alpha held exclusively. The machine
    a hook comes from, as the transport established it, now decides which
    holder of a repeated id is the caller.
  - Role withdrawal dropped the pin before the demotion and saved it
    whatever happened next, so a transient failure (a cancelled context at
    shutdown) left a revoked role held with no record that the config had
    granted it. The pin stays until the withdrawal is settled; the next
    tick retries.
  - The bridge read another machine's supplied index at its path as its own
    and never shipped; the status now says which machine each supplied
    index and each remote tree belongs to, the bridge ships unless the
    index is its own machine's, and doctor says when a path holds another
    machine's tree.
  - The bridge's status request is bounded by the shipper's context and a
    deadline; a daemon that accepted the connection and never answered held
    every later recheck and shipment for that tree.
- **Round eleven of the pre-release review: three findings.**
  - Process ownership (which pid this daemon may probe) is decided from the
    host id before the hostname label: a resume on another machine updates
    the id and carries no label, so an agent resumed on a laptop was probed
    against the hub's kernel and swept dormant with its claims released.
  - Round ten's eviction epoch was stamped on discovery's slow path only,
    and its test stamped the epoch by hand; the fast path a returning agent
    takes now stamps it, and the test goes through the real entry point.
  - On Windows, guard and hook queries are folded to `/` like the ops the
    fold stored, so an exclusive claim on `C:/repo` answers a query for
    `C:\repo\file.go`; the fold is exercised on every platform by a test
    that turns it on.
- **Round ten of the pre-release review: five findings.**
  - A `resume` records the machine it happens on: the same nonce presented
    from another computer is a new activation there, and the row used to
    keep the host it registered on, so its wakes went to the machine it had
    left and its new claims were keyed there.
  - Situational notices (an eviction, an instruction to stop exclusive work)
    are rebuilt after a restart for an ARCHIVED agent too, which resumes to
    them; only closed has nobody to tell.
  - A shipment at the repository ceiling evicts an index nobody is in
    before refusing, as local discovery does; a fleet on supplied indexes
    could not match its seventeenth repository until a restart.
  - Eviction keeps a tree an agent returned to between the pass's snapshot
    of the board and its deletion (an eviction epoch, stamped by discovery).
  - Installing a second index left the fallback scorer on the first while
    the fallback name moved to the second, so releasing the first kept its
    scorer answering `Predict`; both halves now move together.
- **Round nine of the pre-release review: six findings, all on the remote
  wake path.**
  - A remote agent that had just checked in could be woken against its
    running thread: "recently in touch" read the hub's own `[wake.exec]`
    cooldown, and a remote agent's route needs none. The recency window is
    now the route's cooldown, the host bridge's for an agent on another
    machine.
  - A host bridge states its `[wake.exec]` cooldowns when it attaches
    (`_meta com.dibs/wake_cooldowns`) and the hub spends those for that
    machine's agents; every remote wake used to get the fixed default, so a
    machine configured `cooldown = "30m"` was woken again after ninety
    seconds.
  - A stream reconnect fails the hub's pending requests and it retries under
    a new id while the bridge's first command is still running its turn; the
    bridge now runs one command per agent at a time and refuses the retry
    with a report the hub reads as a failed start.
  - The bridge's index shipper reads the agent's directory from the board a
    register or resume reply carries, so a `resume` (which takes no cwd)
    refreshes the right tree's credential.
  - The bridge resolves `register.cwd` and `update.cwd` on its own machine
    like its other path arguments, so a checkout registered as `/tmp/repo`
    beside a root of `/private/tmp/repo` no longer has its index shipment
    refused.
  - The delivery note on `send` describes the recipient's route: for an
    agent on another machine that is its host's bridge, never the hub's
    command, and the note says when no bridge is attached there.
  - Giving remote agents the recency check exposed that a bridge's inbox
    subscription counted as the agent being in touch: opened or reopened
    after the agent's own Stop hook, it read as a running turn and the next
    question was deferred for the whole cooldown. A subscription now
    authenticates without stamping liveness; the two-host suite is what
    caught it. `DIBS_LOG_DEBUG=1` on the daemon shows the wake path's
    refusals, which are otherwise invisible.
- **Round eight of the pre-release review: four findings.**
  - The adoption rules' "other hands" is evidence, not proof, and SECURITY.md
    now says so beside the coordinator role: a coordinator on the raw API
    can register a puppet with an invented session and move a mailbox onto
    it, nothing about a session is proven to the daemon, and what bounds
    that is the ledger. The adoption event now carries who did it and where
    the receiver was registered from, so the audit reads in one place.
  - The bridge's index shipper kept the token it captured at registration;
    a resume rotates it, so every later shipment was a 401. The shipper's
    credential is replaced on each register or resume.
  - `differentProjects` read equal Git-directory strings as one repository
    across machines, so two strangers at `/workspace/repo` on two hosts
    declaring `issue:42` were told they shared an objective; the shortcut
    now asks which machine, as the claim rule does.
  - SECURITY.md promised a forged `SessionStart` delays a wake by at most
    one cooldown; one repeated faster than the cooldown defers it for as
    long as the forger keeps calling, which cannot be capped without waking
    agents that are genuinely mid-turn, and the document now says that.
- **Round seven of the pre-release review: seven findings.**
  - Round six's status retraction ran under the match lock, which
    `SetMatchStatus` takes under the status lock: an indexing failure and an
    eviction at the same moment deadlocked, with the writer loop next in
    line. The retraction now runs after the match lock is released
    (reproduced with a bounded test on the round-six code).
  - The coordinator adoption rules read an EMPTY registration provenance as
    "unrelated", and provenance is whatever the caller's transport stamped:
    a stateless caller registering with no session at all was a third party.
    Other hands now need positive evidence, a session or a provenance of the
    target's own that the coordinator does not hold, and the refusal says
    what the target lacks.
  - The bridge's index shipper watched the bridge's own directory; it now
    watches the directory the agent registered (or moved to with `update`),
    one shipper per tree.
  - The MCP bundle carries `dibs-presence` and `Dibs.app` beside the
    binaries, which look for them there: started from the bundle, the daemon
    had no Touch ID and no branded notifications.
  - On Linux, `Available()` on the writer loop no longer waits for the
    notifier probe's subprocesses: it reads what is known and assumes
    reachable while the measurement runs (the send settles off the loop);
    `Reach` still measures.
  - The frozen `AgentInfo` tag list has a fingerprint, like the Op's and
    the Message's, so a sweep that renames `repo_remote` and its entry
    together is caught (shown by making that rename).
  - The bundle's description said Windows users use the release archives;
    there is no Windows build, and it says so.
- **Round six of the pre-release review: five findings.**
  - Role withdrawal now also finds a holder whose credential only the nonce
    index still carries (a sweep written before v0.0.8 blanked the archived
    row's nonce and kept the index entry that lets it resume), so an archived
    holder cannot resume into a role the config withdrew.
  - A remote agent's wake never falls through to the hub's local command
    when its bridge detaches between the route decision and the plan.
  - Releasing a supplied index retracts the status that credited it, so the
    bridge ships again when the agent returns instead of reading "supplied"
    forever.
  - The read-verdict restart test rebuilds from the replayed ledger rather
    than a copy of live state, so it now fails for the in-memory-only
    mutation it exists to exclude (shown by making it).
  - The #113 changelog entry described the rejected fold-side backslash
    folding; it now describes what shipped.
- **Round five of the pre-release review: eight findings.**
  - Withdrawing a declared role resolved the declared NAME again, so a
    holder that had renamed itself or been archived was "nobody", the pin
    was dropped and the role stayed with no record that the config had
    granted it. Withdrawal now finds the holder by the credential the pin
    recorded, whatever it calls itself now.
  - A remote caller's claim, release and guard paths were canonicalised on
    the hub's filesystem (a Linux member's `/tmp/repo/file` became
    `/private/tmp/repo/file` on a macOS hub), so its checkout root no longer
    prefixed them and cross-machine collisions disappeared. Every path a
    tool takes now goes through the decision registration already made, and
    the stdio bridge resolves path arguments on its own machine before
    sending them, so the spelling an agent types meets the spelling its
    bridge registered where the filesystem is.
  - A host bridge attaching (or reattaching, or attaching after the hub's
    boot retries ran) re-arms wakes for every agent on that machine holding
    blocking mail; a wake refused for want of a bridge scheduled no retry.
  - A verdict owed to an ARCHIVED asker is rebuilt after a restart (archived
    is idle and resumable; only closed has nobody left to tell), and the
    responder is told the asker is archived rather than that it "closed its
    agent".
  - A supplied index lost to a daemon restart is shipped again: the bridge
    keeps looking at the verdict for its lifetime (every five minutes after
    the registration schedule), ships whenever the daemon wants an index
    nobody has supplied, and the boot walk relists remote trees.
  - `all_mail(agent: x)` returned every mailbox to an admin; the filter the
    schema advertised is now applied.
  - `docs/NETWORK.md` said a credentialed identity is wakeable "forever";
    the retention purge still removes an archived row and its nonce after
    `ArchiveRetention`, and the document now says so in both places.
  - Two Unreleased entries described superseded states (Windows tests
    "fail there"; networking "not built beyond liveness"); both now say what
    this version ships.
- **Round four of the pre-release review: eight findings.**
  - `dibs codex-hooks --trust` vouched for any loose hook whose JSON
    mentioned `hook_poll` anywhere, so a command hook with that status
    message, or an MCP hook on another server, was trusted, which is Codex's
    authorisation to run it. It now vouches for exactly one shape: an MCP
    tool hook calling `hook_poll` on the `dibs` server, plugin or loose.
  - A bridge on another machine never shipped its index: the daemon
    (correctly) never looks for a remote path, so no unreadable verdict was
    ever recorded and the bridge polled its schedule out. Match status now
    lists remote trees apart from unreadable ones, the bridge ships on that
    list, and doctor names a remote tree whose index has not arrived.
  - An index shipped from another machine scored a local agent at the same
    path; a shipped index now scores the shipper's machine only, in both
    directions.
  - A second machine shipping the same fingerprint for a path already held
    for the first was told "already installed" about an index the scorer
    would then refuse it; ownership is checked before the shortcut.
  - The daemon's and the host bridge's service units carry the installing
    shell's `PATH`, so a wake command written the way the documentation
    writes it (`claude`, `codex`) resolves under launchd or systemd as it
    does in the terminal; both used to fail every wake with "executable file
    not found" while doctor counted the route as covering.
  - On Windows the daemon-registry lock covered byte 0 of the registration
    JSON, and `LockFileEx` is mandatory, so every live daemon read as
    Unknown and `stop`/`upgrade` could not find the one running. The lock
    now sits far past the body; the Windows CI job runs the test.
  - The review runner accepted a `FINDINGS: <n>` line anywhere in the
    output, and a negative one; it must now be the reviewer's last word,
    with only the harness's own trailer after it.
  - The coordinator instructions (`dibs://staff`) said adoption redirects
    future mail for the name; it moves what is there once, and the row keeps
    receiving until pruned, which the three-step procedure now says.
- **Round three of the pre-release review: nine code findings, each
  reproduced with a test that fails on the commit before its fix.**
  - A coordinator could become the reader of an abandoned mailbox by
    registering a second agent from its own session, adopting the mailbox
    `into` it, and reading with the token `register` had handed it, or by
    approving that agent's request to adopt. The daemon now records where a
    registration came from (`registered_from`, a frozen tag: the session the
    stdio bridge or the harness stamped on the call, kept whether or not it
    was granted as an alias) and both adoption doors treat an agent minted
    from a session the coordinator holds, or a child it vouched for, as the
    coordinator under another name (`core.Agent.SameHands`).
  - `/api/match-status` JSON-encoded a map that a concurrent index shipment
    wrote into: a data race and, on a bad day, a fatal concurrent map access.
    Shipments now copy the map.
  - An agent on another machine at a path this daemon has a tree of its own
    at was scored by this daemon's index of the other project, and its
    registration scheduled a local discovery of the remote path. An index
    mined here now applies to a remote agent only when both are positively
    the same project (a clone); a shipped index applies only on the
    shipper's machine; a remote agent's path is never discovered locally, and
    its shipment is accepted without a local unreadable verdict. A member's
    tree at a path the hub has a different tree of its own at gets no index
    at all, said plainly, rather than the wrong one.
  - A claim's absolute-path rule read its holder's CURRENT host, so a holder
    that later reported another machine left its claims protecting nothing
    on the first. The host is recorded on the claim when it is taken.
  - A renewal restated the claim's relative path and kept the repository it
    was relative to, so a holder that moved projects at one absolute path
    renewed a claim on the project it had left. Both are restated together.
  - A declaration covering a whole checkout reported no overlap with work in
    a subdirectory of another worktree of the same repository: the declared
    paths signal still compared "." as a string where the claim rule already
    knew it is the checkout.
  - Eviction at the repository ceiling dropped a supplied index under an
    agent registered from a subdirectory of its root, because discovery had
    failed on that tree (which is why it was supplied) and left no mapping.
    A directory under an indexed root is that root's.
  - A resumed agent's tree is offered for discovery as a registered one's is:
    an archived agent's index is evicted, and the resume path rebuilt nothing.
  - The bridge's shipment fallback polled the daemon's verdict at the
    configured address while the shipment itself went to the address Supgang
    resolved, so after a hub moved the index never shipped.
  The tenth finding was prose: `docs/NETWORK.md` and the 0.0.7 changelog
  entry described the per-host wake bridge as unbuilt a release after it
  shipped; both now say what is built and what is not.
- **A session that never registered is a stranger even beside a registered
  agent, once that agent's own hooks resolve.** The hook-health counters
  read any unresolved lifecycle call from a directory with an active agent
  as a misbinding, which is only right while that agent could be the caller.
  The pre-release reviewer, a Codex session run in this checkout that never
  registers by design, turned `dibs doctor` red ("somebody's mail is not
  being delivered") beside an agent whose every hook resolved, and the
  daemon logged it at INFO as a wake path reaching no one. A miss now counts
  as a misbinding only while some active agent in that directory could still
  be the caller: one no hook has reached since the daemon started AND that
  holds no thread-shaped session id (a hook from its own session would quote
  the thread it holds). The second clause is what keeps a fresh daemon
  honest: hooks fire at turn boundaries, so with the reached set alone
  `dibs upgrade` followed by the reviewer's first hook read "the guard is
  inert" for the length of the seat's turn. The fault shape is unchanged for
  an agent bound to `host-<ppid>` or to nothing.
- **The stdio bridge finds its Claude Code session by its parent, not by
  `CLAUDE_PID`.** Claude Code 2.1.275 exports `CLAUDE_PID` to shell children
  and not to MCP servers, so every plugin bridge read no sidecar: `_meta
  com.dibs/session` carried `host-<ppid>` on every call, `check_in` bound that
  as an alias, and the sidecar's cwd, surface and title never reached the
  board (measured on this project's own board on 2026-09-19; `register` still
  bound the right primary through `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, which is why only
  a `check_in` result reading `"session_id": "host-62908"` gave it away). A
  sidecar named for the bridge's own parent pid is proof that the parent is a
  Claude Code session and that this bridge is its child, which is what
  `CLAUDE_PID` matching the parent was standing in for; the variable is still
  honoured when set, under the same handshake gate for a pid that is not the
  parent's.
- **Nine more findings from the pre-release review's second round, each
  with a test that fails on the code before it.** Removing the LAST declared
  role from `[roles]` withdrew nothing: the reconciler returned before
  loading its pins when both lists were empty, so deleting the sole admin
  line and restarting handed the role straight back; the withdrawal pass now
  runs before that return. A claim compared its holder's CURRENT repository,
  so a holder that moved projects left the claim standing unprotected; the
  claim now records which repository its relative path is in. A Git directory
  path was taken as evidence of one repository across machines, so two
  unrelated checkouts at `/workspace/repo/.git` on two hosts collided; with
  two hosts only the remote and the root commits count. A host bridge that
  reconnected left its old connection's pending wakes holding for the whole
  wake timeout; they fail as they do on detach. `dibs doctor` counted the
  hub's own `[wake.exec]` as coverage for an agent on another machine whose
  directory happened to exist here too; it asks where the agent is first. Its
  Codex hook line read a trust table and could not tell a stale hash from a
  current one; it asks Codex's app-server now, which reports "modified" and
  "untrusted" per hook. Two bridges starting together on a fresh directory
  could each mint a host id and cache their own, leaving one machine with two
  identities; the file is created exclusively and the loser reads the
  winner's. A supplied index applied the operator's join threshold and
  auto-join policy to scores built from an agent's own data, which
  `SECURITY.md` promised it never would; its scores are suggestions only.
  And the changelog, SPEC §16 and two comments still described the loopback
  host rule round one replaced.

- **Nine findings from the pre-release review, each with a test that fails
  on the code before it.** A coordinator could adopt a mailbox onto itself
  by sending itself the request and approving it; refused now like the direct
  route. The Windows fix for claim paths folded `\` to `/` inside the fold,
  which changed what unix ledgers meant (a backslash is a filename character
  there); the fold no longer knows a second separator and Windows spellings
  are folded at ingress, where the host is a recorded fact. The Linux
  notifier's probe (two subprocesses, five seconds each) ran on the
  single-writer loop on every message to the human; it runs once per process
  and the loop reads a cached answer. A caller on another machine got its
  checkout identity from Git on the hub, which cannot see that checkout, so
  the repository rule across hosts never fired for a real remote clone: the
  bridge now resolves its own checkout and sends it, and the hub takes that
  word for a remote caller (the remote e2e runs its hub with no Git, so the
  rule can only pass through the bridge). A remote bridge reaching the hub
  through the documented ssh forward arrived over loopback and was stamped as
  the hub's own machine; an asserted host id is honoured whatever the
  transport. A claim over a whole checkout (repo path `.`) covered nothing in
  another worktree of the repository, in the fold and in the guard. A
  pending remote wake was not bound to its host: another host detaching
  failed it and another host's report satisfied it. Wake ids restarted from
  zero with the hub while a reconnecting bridge kept the ids of commands
  still running. On a Supgang member the restart index compared agents with
  the ledger's node id rather than the daemon's host id and skipped every
  local checkout. And index shipping stopped looking after forty-eight
  seconds while the daemon waits four minutes on Git before saying a tree is
  unreadable, so the fallback never fired for the case that motivated it.

- **`task review:release` fails when the reviewer did not review.** The brief
  now ends with a `FINDINGS: <count>` line and the runner requires it: a run
  whose reviewer said in so many words that it could not read the diff (its
  tool router was broken) had exited 0, and an earlier one exited 0 with no
  findings and no explanation. A gate that passes on "I did not look" is not a
  gate; now it names what stopped the reviewer and exits non-zero.

- **`dibs mcp-config` says not to paste its stdio block into
  `claude_desktop_config.json` on a machine with the Claude Code plugin**, at
  the block, because that is exactly where it was pasted from. Removing an
  entry that is already there means Settings → Developer or the app quit: the
  app keeps the table in memory and writes the whole file back on any
  preference change.
- **`dibs doctor` catches a Claude Desktop config that shadows the Claude Code
  plugin.** A `dibs` server in `claude_desktop_config.json` is handed to
  Code-tab sessions under the plugin's name and the plugin's server disappears
  from them; an agent registering there binds the app bridge's `host-<pid>`
  (spawned from `/` by the app, so no sidecar names its parent) instead of its
  session UUID, and its
  hooks resolve to nobody. Measured on this project's own board on 2026-09-15.
  Doctor now reads both files and names the fix when both are present; the
  Claude Desktop plugin README says not to combine them, and the harness
  survey carries the app's measured handshake (2025-11-25 on both of its
  clients, never `server/discover`).

- **`dibs doctor` no longer calls the guard inert because unregistered
  sessions asked it.** The plugin is installed machine-wide, so every session
  of that harness calls `guard_path` and `hook_poll`, including the ones whose
  agent never registered, and the daemon summed those into the failure
  counters: a board where every registered agent resolved read "10 of 12
  guard calls did not resolve to an agent" for a month, all of them from one
  directory nobody had registered from. `/api/hook-health` now counts a miss
  as a **stranger** when no agent is active in the directory the hook named
  (an unregistered session: usage, reported beside the verdict) and as
  unresolved only when an active agent works there and the hook still named
  nobody, which is the misbound session id that leaves an agent unwakeable
  and is still reported as a fault. A daemon that has only ever heard from
  strangers says so (`only-strangers`, a warning) instead of claiming a broken
  join.

- **The hub's own agents trust the certificate their daemon made.** A hub
  bound to a LAN address serves TLS to everybody, its own machine included,
  and the bridge beside it refused the certificate it lives next to: every
  local call failed with "the daemon was reached and the answer was not"
  until the operator pinned their own daemon with `dibs trust`, a step the
  join recipe never mentions because it is not a join. The bridge now trusts
  `tls-ca.pem` in its own data directory, the CA that daemon signs with.
  Found by the two-host suite below.
- **A restarted daemon indexes the trees its agents already work in.**
  Indexing was triggered by registration alone, so every `dibs upgrade` (or
  reboot) switched work-overlap matching off for the whole board until some
  agent happened to register afresh, and on a board of long-lived agents
  that was hours or days: this machine's own board had 34 agents and no
  index hours after an upgrade, with nothing but doctor's "no repository
  indexed yet" to say so. The daemon now resolves, at boot, the working
  directory of every live agent on this machine to its repository and
  indexes each repository once.
- **Claim paths fold with one separator, so the state machine holds on
  Windows.** (#113) `cleanPath` used `filepath.Clean`, which on Windows
  spelled every claim with `\` while every comparison in the package writes
  `/`: the first Windows run granted an exclusive claim over a file another
  agent held exclusively. A claim is a path an agent supplied and the ledger
  replays on whichever host holds it, so the fold now uses `path.Clean`, one
  separator on every host. The first cut of this folded `\` to `/` inside
  the fold as well, and the pre-release review caught what that does to a
  unix ledger: a backslash is an ordinary character in a unix filename, so
  claims over `/tmp/a\b` and `/tmp/a/b` replayed collapsed into one. Windows
  spellings are folded at ingress instead, recorded into the op, and the
  fold never rewrites a recorded path. Two tests assumed unix as well (a ledger left
  open at cleanup, a Windows path in a TOML basic string). The `windows`
  job now runs the state machine, the ledger and the board config alongside
  the scorer and liveness.
- **`dibs hook-poll` reports a dead daemon as a failure.** (#24, from the
  Codex review of #101) It printed `{}` and exited 0 whatever went wrong, so a
  daemon that had been down for a week was indistinguishable from a board
  with nothing to say. A daemon that did not answer, or input that is not the
  hook's JSON, now exits 1 with the reason on stderr, which Gemini shows as a
  warning and carries on; an event the harness cannot deliver at is still
  `{}` and exit 0. The hook's input is bounded at a megabyte before it is
  decoded, and the Stop-only `stop_hook_active` field is no longer read.
- **A shipped index scores only the agents the daemon cannot place.** (#19,
  from the Codex review of #102) An agent could ship an index rooted at a
  PARENT of its checkout and have every neighbouring checkout scored by it,
  and a payload naming a real project's remote joined that project's peer
  set. The daemon now refuses a root that is not the agent's own repository,
  takes a shipment only for a tree it has itself found unreadable, and uses
  a shipped index for the agents in that tree, never for an agent whose
  repository is another one, and never as a peer. The
  bridge reports a refused shipment instead of logging success, a file named
  `version..txt` is no longer mistaken for a path escape, and the shipped
  history carries every commit the fingerprint counted.
- **On Linux, a checkout replaced at the same path was still identified as
  the old one.** The repository-identity cache keyed on device and inode, and
  ext4 and tmpfs hand a recreated directory the same inode back, so the cache
  answered the deleted repository's remote for the new one: two agents in one
  repository were not warned, and an unrelated project was reported as
  duplicating work. Found by the first run of the suite on a Linux runner;
  APFS never showed it. Change and modification time are part of the identity
  now, and the stat is split by platform so the same file builds on Windows.

- **On Linux, processor time is read from `/proc`, not from a `ps` column
  that rounds to whole seconds.** (#4, the measured half) The supervision
  probe decides "thinking" against "stuck" from the ratio of processor time
  to age, and read both from `ps -o time=,etime=`, whose TIME is hundredths
  on macOS and whole seconds on procps: a process that had burned 50 ms
  measured on one and rounded to zero on the other, and at `--min-duty 0.05`
  with a one-second age a continuously busy process was reported stuck in
  two runs of eight. Linux now reads `utime + stime` in clock ticks from
  `/proc/<pid>/stat` and the age from `starttime` against `/proc/uptime`,
  behind a build tag; the BSD `ps` path is untouched on macOS. The parser is
  tested here. Measured and reported by @averyquinnhq (#4), who ran the
  published v0.0.1 Linux binary against the release checksums. (When this was written the Linux build was compiled and
  vetted and not run; later in the same cycle the CI gained a Linux job that
  runs every package under the race detector, and the README's account of
  what is verified where follows that, not this sentence.)

- **A verdict the asker has read is not handed back after a restart.** (#76)
  `read_mail` cleared the "read_mail(N)" notice only in memory. The rebuild
  after a restart asks whether the asker's awareness watermark has passed the
  verdict, and only `check_in` moves that watermark, so a daemon restarted
  between an agent reading its outcome and its next activation delivered the
  same notice once more. The sender reading a verdict is now ledgered
  (`outcome_read`, once per message, silent), the rebuild reads it, and a
  restart tells the agent nothing it has already read. `Consumed` was never
  the answer: it is the recipient's marker and is set the moment a verdict
  exists.

- **A restart no longer loses the notices that carry instructions.** (#75)
  Verdicts were rebuilt from state after a restart; everything else a notice
  can say (you were evicted, admitted, absorbed, requeued; somebody joined
  your space) lived only in memory. The old comment said the cost of losing
  one was a repeated notice, which is true of "somebody joined" and false of
  "stop work there": an agent told to stop carried on, because the
  instruction was what disappeared. The daemon seeds its event ring from
  replay, and those notices are now rebuilt from it at start, gated on the
  same awareness watermark the verdict rebuild uses, so an agent that has
  checked in since is not told again. The deferred-wake half of this issue
  was already closed by the boot re-arm.
- **Two clones of one project are compared inside a coordinate system they
  share.** (#39) A co-change index is mined per checkout and names files the
  way that checkout lays them out. Two clones with divergent histories put the
  same concern at different paths, so two agents declaring identical work
  predicted disjoint sets, scored zero, and were told nothing: the duplicate
  collided when one fix was ported. A declaration is now also scored in every
  other index of its project whose history differs, each answer recorded on
  the op with the fingerprint of the history it was scored in, and two slots
  are judged inside the best system both carry. An agent is never shown a
  path from a peer's index; when the deciding system is a peer's, the score
  stands, the paths are withheld, and the explanation names the peer's tree.
  Old slots carry no footprints and compare exactly as before. Proven end to
  end: two real clones, one with the concern moved, warn where they were
  silent. The indexes are the same ones as before; a project with one
  checkout records nothing new.

- **A view transition that hangs no longer leaves the board unclickable.**
  (#84) While a transition is live the browser's overlay swallows pointer
  events, and `data-transition` came off only when `finished` settled, so a
  transition the renderer stopped driving left the board rendering perfectly
  and taking no clicks until reload. It is bounded now: two seconds, then the
  transition is skipped and the attribute released. The test hangs one on
  purpose and asserts both halves of the release; it does not depend on the
  suite's flake rate, which is what kept the fix out the first time.

- **The determinism gate generates every mutating op.** (#3) The randomized
  replay walk behind `state == fold(ledger)` never generated nine of them
  (`update`, `clear_slot`, `release`, `force_release`, `mark_delivered`,
  `adopt_agent`, `claim_coordinator`, `prune_own`, `sign_off`) nor any of the
  flags recorded on ops since v0.0.7, so none of those had a replay guarantee
  whatever the rest of the suite said. All are generated now, each is covered
  once deterministically so coverage does not depend on the seed, and an
  injected impure read in `update` is caught. The walk replayed identically
  with all of them in, on the first run.

- **Removing a role from `dibs.toml` now takes it away.** (#73) `[roles]`
  decided what was granted and never what was withdrawn, so a role deleted
  from the file survived on the ledger and the reconciler declined to grant
  it again: the god view over every mailbox, held by an agent the config no
  longer named, until `dibs admin member` was run by hand. The reconciler now
  withdraws what it granted and can prove it granted through `roles.pinned`,
  when the name leaves `[roles]` or `[roles.identity]` is repointed at another
  fingerprint. A role a person granted by hand is not touched, a person's
  decision during the run stands in this direction as it did for regrants,
  and a stale pin under a name a different credential now holds is dropped
  rather than used to demote somebody it never described.

- **`read_mail` on somebody else's message said the message did not exist.**
  (#36, item four) A serial between two other agents answered `E_NO_MESSAGE`,
  "no accessible message", hint "check the serial": the same confident and
  false statement the announcement case had been fixed for, and an agent on a
  live board concluded mail was being lost. It is now `E_NOT_YOUR_MESSAGE`,
  naming the two ids and never the body. An inherited serial keeps the
  watermark wording, because naming the parties would tell a replacement that
  its name had a predecessor.

- **`dibs doctor` on Linux now says what the missing notifier costs.** (#63,
  the honest third of it) "This platform has no notification route" was true
  and said nothing about the consequence: a request that needs the operator
  waits on the board until they look. It now says so, names `dibs web` as the
  place the buttons are, and names the issue for the notifier itself. (When
  this was written the notifier was not built and CI ran on macOS alone; both
  changed within the same cycle, see the Linux notifier entry below and the
  `linux` job. The sentence is left as the record of what was true on the day,
  not as a description of this release.)

- **Three tool descriptions still said "agent" where they meant "space".**
  Casualties of the vocabulary rename: `evict` told every agent to "remove an
  agent from an agent it should not be in", `admit` to "add another agent to
  an agent", and `dibs://skills` said a ref could put you "in an agent".

- **A re-register while live dropped the identity it carried.** (#78) The
  same-nonce register of a still-active agent decided whether anything had
  changed from sessions, pid and nonce alone, so a corrected `cwd`, or the
  `host_id` the server had just derived, matched nothing and was answered
  with the old row and `resumed: true`. Every agent already on a board when
  `host_id` shipped was in that position, and no row on the development board
  gained one after the upgrade. A differing identity is now a change, is
  ledgered as one, and the row takes what the server derived; an identical
  retry is still the lost-response retry it always was and keeps its token.
  Gated on the register op, because the half of this path that was already
  ledgered dropped the identity on its way to disk and must go on doing so on
  replay. `update` now carries the machine as well, so an agent that never
  re-registers is not stranded without one.

- **Two agents on different computers collided over a path they merely spell
  the same.** One daemon serves agents on other machines and has since v1
  (SPEC §16: bind `--addr`), so their absolute paths arrive in one namespace,
  and `/Users/kim/src/api` on two laptops is two unrelated trees. The second
  agent's exclusive claim was refused over files the first has never seen, and
  the refusal named a holder whose path the reader could go and look at, finding
  their own work. An agent now carries a `host_id`: what its bridge asserts,
  or, for a loopback caller that asserts nothing, the daemon's own node id
  (this entry used to say a loopback caller was stamped "and nothing it says
  moves it"; the documented ssh forward arrives over loopback too, so an
  assertion is honoured on any transport, see the round-one fix above). Only
  positive evidence of two machines suppresses a path collision;
  an agent that supplied none collides exactly as before, which is every agent
  on every board written before this shipped. The repository rule is untouched
  and is what still catches the real cross-machine case: two clones of one
  project name the same file identically once each checkout root is subtracted.

- **`dibs doctor` counted an agent it cannot wake as covered.** A wake command
  runs on the daemon's machine, in the agent's own working directory, and the
  coverage check asked whether a command and a thread existed but never whether
  that directory is here. It is not, for a removed worktree or for an agent on
  another computer, and the wake then runs where the daemon does, where the
  documented command refuses to start. Such an agent is now reported as having
  no route, with advice about the directory rather than a configuration block
  the operator already has. The locality rule itself is written down for the
  first time, in `WAKE-MECHANISMS.md` §5a and `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`: it is the
  constraint every fleet design runs into and neither route advertised it.

- **Claims missed the collision between two linked worktrees of one
  repository.** A claim was an absolute path compared as a raw string, so
  `/a/wt1/pkg/x.go` and `/a/wt2/pkg/x.go` did not overlap: the same tracked
  file, two agents, and both told they held it exclusively. The declare-time
  signal had scoped by repository since it was written, so the weaker signal
  knew about the collision and the stronger one did not, and the write guard
  did not either, which is the half that costs work: the board reported a
  conflict the enforcement path waved through. Claims now overlap under either
  of two rules, and the refusal says which one fired. The second requires
  POSITIVE evidence of one repository and a portable name on both sides;
  anything less stays silent, because a conflict between strangers is an agent
  stopping work nothing else is doing.

- **An agent that went quiet for thirty-five minutes became permanently
  unreachable.** Archiving is a timer, not a decision: an ephemeral agent
  reaches it `agent_ttl` + `stale_grace` after its last call, five minutes plus
  thirty on the defaults. Four separate paths asked `Gone()`, which is
  `closed || archived`, and treated the two as one thing, so from that moment
  mail addressed to the agent was refused with `E_NO_AGENT: no live agent`, no
  wake would be attempted for the mail it already held, the boot retry skipped
  it, and `resume` with its own nonce was refused with the advice to register a
  new agent, which forks a sibling holding an empty mailbox beside the full one.
  The board kept the row, the mailbox and the nonce index for seven days
  precisely so the agent could come back, and for those seven days it was
  recoverable and unreachable at once. `closed` is unchanged: a deliberate
  `sign_off` is still final, and the reasoning written against resuming one
  still stands, because that was always the only half of `Gone()` those
  comments argued.

- **Archiving destroyed the credential in one place and kept it in another.**
  The sweep cleared the agent's `nonce` field while `s.Nonces`, the index
  `register` and `resume` actually consult, was retained until
  `archive_retention`. Three of the v0.0.7 cycle's defects came out of that
  gap, all of them privileged rows the engine then declined to recover because
  the row it was recovering had no nonce to check. Archiving now clears the
  token, which is one activation's credential and is what makes the next call
  return `E_BAD_TOKEN` with the way back, and leaves the nonce. Gated on the
  sweep op, so a ledger written by any earlier version replays to the board
  that version built.

- **A sender addressing an archived agent was told nothing.** With the send
  refused, no note existed for the case; now that it is accepted, `send`
  reports that the recipient was archived, what it costs to reach it, and how
  long the mailbox is kept, and the engine's own note still wins where it knows
  that nothing on this board can wake it.

## [0.0.8] - never published

The tag `v0.0.8` exists and there is no release behind it. The release
workflow re-runs the whole gate against the tagged commit before it publishes
anything, and it stopped on a board defect that had been dismissed as a flaky
browser check an hour earlier: an explanation the reader had opened with the
keyboard was closed by a pointer event the board's own redraw synthesised.
Nothing was published, which is the pipeline working.

Release tags in this repository are immutable by rule, which is deliberate and
right: a tag that can move is a tag nobody can pin. So the tag stays where it
is, the version is spent, and everything 0.0.8 was going to be went out as
0.0.9. If you are looking at the tag list and wondering, that is the whole
story.

## [0.0.7] - 2026-09-08

### Security

- **Recovering into a new session left the previous session's token working.**
  The branch that recognises a real move re-armed the awareness gate, took the
  process and repointed every session binding, while handing back the row's
  existing credential. The session the agent had just left could therefore
  still read the mailbox, still act in whatever role the row carries, and move
  the wake routing back to itself on its next call. `SECURITY.md` promises the
  previous token is revoked on register, reattach and resume, and on this path
  it was not. A response-loss retry still keeps its token, because an identical
  registration arriving twice is one call whose answer was lost and rotating
  there would revoke the credential the caller is already using.

- **A register vetted for one peer's thread could strip another active
  peer's session id.** The fold dropped both ids a register carried from every
  other row once the ingress had named one holder, and the ingress vets only
  thread-shaped primary ids: a register carrying a dormant peer's thread as its
  alias and an active peer's synthetic `host-` id as its `session_id` took
  both, and the active peer's hooks resolved to the newcomer. Each binding is
  dropped on its own authority: the row the ingress named, a row that is not
  active, or one that only guessed the id.

- **An approved `grant: member` could be undone by the reconciler.** The
  protection for a person's role decision covered the admin API's grant and
  not the other way a person changes a role: approving a grant request. A
  tick in the startup window after an approved demotion put the configured
  role back. A grant a person approves stands like one they make directly.

- **A minted recovery nonce was written to the ledger in the clear.** The
  ledger seals the nonce a caller states; the one the daemon mints for a
  caller that sends none, this cycle's default, went into `ledger.jsonl` as
  plaintext. A copied ledger gave up every default registration's recovery
  credential without the key. It is sealed and opened like the stated one.

- **The reconciler could still undo a person's demotion.** Round eighteen
  recorded the person's decision beside the loop, after the demotion had
  applied; a reconciler tick between the two re-granted. The decision is now
  made on the engine's loop with the grant itself: a role set by a person
  through the admin API stands against a plain regrant for the rest of the
  run, with no interleaving to lose.

- **The documented handover could leave the predecessor with admin.** The
  startup reconciler reapplies `dibs.toml` every fifteen seconds for two
  minutes, and the handover says to demote first, then edit, then restart: a
  tick between the demotion and the restart put the role back and ledgered
  it. A role a person changes through the admin API during a run stands for
  the rest of that run; the restart reads the file the person edited.

- **A retired holder could recover and reclaim another agent's live
  session.** A signed-off row keeps its session bindings; the ingress counts
  a retired row as no holder, so another agent took the thread; nonce
  recovery then revived the old row with its bindings intact. Two active
  holders, and hooks resolved to the old one. A revived row yields every
  session another live row holds.

- **The nonce-only rule for privileged rows read the name and not the id.**
  The `[roles]` table resolves an agent by id as well as by name, and a row
  renamed for display keeps the id the table names, so a declared identity
  awaiting its first grant could still be recovered by its display name and
  a session id. The guard reads both.

- **A role could be recovered without its credential.** An agent that
  registers without a nonce is given one, and until it is lost, a name plus a
  session id, neither of them secret, reattaches that row: the
  persistent-by-default convenience. The role and the pinned fingerprint stay
  with the row, so for a row holding admin or coordinator, or bearing a name
  the operator declared for one, that convenience was a fresh privileged
  token for anyone who could read a session id off a hook, and the reconciler
  would grant the role to whoever recovered a declared name before its first
  grant. Those rows are recovered by their nonce and nothing else, refused at
  ingress with `E_NEEDS_NONCE`; the daemon hands the engine the declared
  names at startup.

- **One registration could take two session ids from two rows and free only
  one.** The ingress vets the session id a caller states and the alias the
  daemon joins into one "taken from" record; when the primary came from a
  dormant A and the alias from a dormant B, the record named one of them and
  the other kept its id alongside the registrant. Two stated holders the
  moment it checked in, and a coin flip on every hook. The fold drops each
  id from the row the record names for it, from a row that is not active,
  and from one that only guessed it; an active row that stated an id the
  record does not name keeps it, because the ingress did not find it
  claimable (see the first Security entry).

- **An explicit `bind_session` left the id reclaimable.** An id inferred for
  an agent is recorded as a guess, and a live claim may take a guess even
  from an active holder, which is right for a guess. Binding that id
  explicitly assigned it and left the guess standing, so the confirmation
  protected nothing. An explicit bind is stated now.

- **A nonce recovery that stated a session id left the old holder holding it
  too.** The ingress vets a session id a caller states and the alias the
  daemon joins into one "taken from" record, and the fold dropped only the
  alias from the row that lost it. So an agent reattaching with its nonce and
  its `session_id` took a thread from a holder that had stopped answering and
  left that holder holding it: two stated holders, and on the old one's next
  `check_in` a coin flip on every hook, including which agent's mail a hook
  lists. Both fields are dropped now, at the one place every bind calls.

- **An adoption marked mail as recoverable, and the mark outlived the name it
  was for.** The round-three fix for adopted mail below the heir's watermark
  marked each moved message `adopted_from`, and every reader exempted marked
  mail from the watermark. The mark said an adoption happened. It did not say
  to whom: a name is purged and comes back as the same id, registration raises
  the watermark to keep the previous occupant's mail from the replacement, and
  the mark walked straight through it. The replacement could read, by inbox
  and by serial, the mail the predecessor had been given.

  Each adoption now records its serial as well (`adopted_serial`, a frozen
  tag), and the exemption belongs to the incarnation whose creation precedes
  it. One rule, `adoptedFor`, for every reader of the mark; the engine's
  `read_mail` and delivery marking call the same one.

- **Adopting a mailbox handed over mail the mailbox had been told was not its
  own.** `TruncatedBefore` is the watermark that stops a name coming back from
  reading the previous occupant's mail: an id is derived from the name, so a
  returning name reuses the id, and a sweep written before v0.0.7 removes the
  agent row while keeping the messages. `Inbox` filters on it. Both adoption
  paths, direct and approved-request, read every message matching the id and
  readdressed it, so the one route that exists to RECOVER an abandoned mailbox
  was also the route that disclosed the mail that mailbox had been excluded
  from.

  Worse than an ordinary leak because of who authorises it: the approver is
  shown a count. Nothing in the request says some of those messages were
  addressed to somebody else entirely, so the human granting it cannot see what
  they are granting. Authorising the recovery of an identity is not authorising
  the disclosure of its predecessor's mail. Both paths go through one helper
  now, since two copies of one rule is how only one of them got fixed the last
  three times. Found by the pre-release review, with a reproduction.

- **`human_unlock` raised a system sheet on the operator's screen for a caller
  it had not authenticated.** The sentence on that sheet is the entire control:
  a person is asked to approve something, and the one field telling them who is
  asking came from `CallerName`, which ANSWERS for a token it does not know,
  with "an unidentified caller". Right in a log line, wrong here. So anything
  holding the coordination secret could make the machine ask its human to
  approve a request attributed to nobody, while `SECURITY.md` claimed the
  requester was resolved "from the authenticated token". Nothing authenticated
  it. The call now refuses an unknown token before the sheet is raised.

  Physical approval was still required, so this was never a biometric bypass.
  The attribution was false, and the attribution is what the human decides on.
  Found by the pre-release review.

- **A stolen board session could read every mailbox and grant a role.** Cookies
  are host-scoped and never port-scoped, and `SameSite` does not separate ports
  either, so a second server on `127.0.0.1` receives `dibs_session` as soon as
  the operator visits it and can replay it from outside a browser. That reached
  `/api/messages` and `/api/admin/role`.

  Requiring an `Origin` header, which is what the previous entry here claimed as
  the fix, does not stop it: a process that is not a browser sets its own
  headers and declares the board's own origin. The regression test written with
  that fix asserted the forged request must be **accepted**, so it encoded the
  hole as a requirement.

  Redeeming the magic link now also hands the browser a **page key**, in the
  redirect's fragment: fragments are never sent to a server, and the board keeps
  it in `localStorage`, which is scoped by port. Mail, `/api/me`, `/api/act/*`
  and every `/api/admin/` route require it. The cookie alone still opens the
  board document and `/events` (`EventSource` cannot send a header), and
  neither carries mail. `SECURITY.md` says so plainly rather than claiming the
  exposure is gone.

- **A board session cookie opened the coordination tier, including `/mcp`.**
  `/mcp` is deliberately not a god-view path, so it sat behind "local secret OR
  a valid board session". A local service replaying the host-scoped cookie could
  therefore POST `/mcp`, call `register` (which needs no prior credential) and
  be handed an agent token: the whole coordination surface, without ever holding
  `local.secret`. The tier now takes the local secret, or a board page that has
  proved itself.

- **The page key protected nothing, because the routes it exempted carried all
  the mail.** `SECURITY.md` and the guard both said the board document and
  `/events` carry board state and not mail. Both called `AllMessages`: the
  document embedded every decrypted body in the HTML, and every SSE snapshot
  streamed them. So a cookie thief got the complete mailbox and every update to
  it, straight past the control added for exactly that attacker. The end-to-end
  test *required* a private message body to be present in a cookie-only
  response, so the suite pinned the leak in place. Mail is out of both routes;
  the board fetches it from `/api/messages`, which needs the key.

- **A declared role was granted to whoever registered under the name first.**
  The pin file held every *later* impostor to the first registrant's identity
  and asked the first one nothing, so an agent that read `dibs.toml`, or guessed
  that `admin = ["fleet-lead"]` is a likely line, could register under that name
  before the operator's own agent came up and be handed the god view with every
  agent's mail in it. The two-minute window made that a race, not a safeguard.
  A declared role now requires `[roles.identity]` to name that agent's
  **fingerprint**; without it nothing is granted, and the daemon logs the line
  to paste. **Breaking for anyone using `[roles]`.**

  The first version of this asked for the raw **nonce**, which was worse than
  the hole it closed: a nonce is the whole recovery credential, so any same-user
  process that read `dibs.toml` could reattach *as* the admin, rotate its token
  and take its mailbox at any time, rather than merely winning a two-minute
  race. It takes a 64-character hex fingerprint now, and refuses anything that
  is not one.

- **Published macOS artifacts shipped without the Touch ID helper.** GoReleaser
  built `dibd` and `dibs` and nothing else, and the runtime looks for
  `dibs-presence` beside the executable, so every archive and every `brew
  install` silently fell back to the admin password while the documentation
  described a presence-first flow. The release job already runs on macOS; it
  builds and ships the helper now, and the drift guard that watched only the
  Taskfile watches the release too.

- **An archived coordinator stranded the board.** The claim guard added above
  spelled out its own idea of who coordinates and excluded only closed agents,
  while the resolver everything else uses correctly ignores archived ones.
  Archiving blanks the token and nonce and resume refuses archived identities,
  so a board whose only coordinator was swept had nobody able to coordinate and
  no way to claim it. It asks the one resolver now.

  Round seven found the same defect in a *second* copy, `core.HasCoordinator`,
  which is the one the startup claim path actually consults, so the strand
  survived the first fix. It is defined as `CoordinatorID` now rather than as
  its own scan of the roster: two functions cannot disagree if there is only one
  of them.

- **`DIBS_ADDR` schemes were accepted and then discarded.** The daemon read the
  variable, stripped `http://` or `https://` so `net.Listen` would take it, and
  re-inferred the transport from the bare address, while every client honours
  the scheme. `http://10.0.0.9:4777` served TLS to clients speaking plaintext;
  `https://127.0.0.1:4777` served plaintext to clients speaking TLS. The scheme
  is now carried into the shared transport rule, an uppercase one is lowercased
  rather than failing later inside Go's HTTP transport, and `http://` alongside
  a configured certificate is refused as the contradiction it is.

- **A launch claim stayed usable after the board had a coordinator.** The claim
  file is minted at startup when none exists, and a role declared in
  `dibs.toml` is granted seconds later by the reconciler, so an ordinary
  startup left a live claim in the data directory beside a board that already
  had its coordinator. A second persistent agent that read it, which is
  same-user readable and documented to be, could take broadcast,
  `force_release`, eviction and mailbox adoption. Refused at ingress, never in
  the fold, so replay still accepts claims that were legal when written.

- **The role pin failed open in two ways**, found by the review round after the
  one that added it. `loadRolePins` treated every read error as "no pins yet",
  so a permissions problem on `roles.pinned` silently re-opened every declared
  role to whoever held its name; and `check` recorded a fingerprint in memory
  before `save` succeeded, so a failed write left it there and the next
  reconciliation fifteen seconds later matched against its own unsaved value
  and granted the role with nothing durable behind it. Both now refuse. A
  security decision that survives only in memory is one that disappears on
  restart while behaving as though it had not.

- **A half-configured certificate pair started the daemon on a transport
  nobody asked for.** With `tls_cert` set and `tls_key` absent (or the
  reverse), both were treated as absent: plaintext on loopback, an unrelated
  self-signed certificate off it, and the operator's explicit setting doing
  nothing silently. Refused now, in the shared config so `dibd -check` and
  `dibs mcp-config` both see it.

- **A declared standing role could be taken by any agent that chose the right
  name.** `[roles] admin = ["release-manager"]` in `dibs.toml` authorises a
  STRING, and an agent picks its own name at registration. So an agent that
  could read that file, or guess the name, registered under it and the
  reconciler granted it admin on the next tick: the god view over every
  decrypted mailbox. Both `SECURITY.md` and `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` promised
  "no agent can promote itself", and it did not have to: it only had to be
  called the right thing before the intended agent was. Present in v0.0.5 and
  v0.0.6, and reproduced against a live daemon before it was changed.

  A declared role now requires the operator to name that agent's **fingerprint**
  under `[roles.identity]`, and without one nothing is granted: see the Security
  entry above, which is the shipping behaviour. The first version of this fix
  pinned the credential of the agent the grant first landed on and welcomed that
  first agent without a question, which is first-registrant-wins wearing a pin;
  the two-minute window made it a race rather than a standing offer, which is
  not the same as making it safe. The pin file survives as a record of which
  identity took the role, and it is checked ALONGSIDE the current configuration
  rather than instead of it, so an agent the operator has stopped naming is not
  granted the role again. **That is not the same as taking it away**: a role is
  replayable state, so an agent that already holds one keeps it across a restart
  until something demotes it, and `dibs admin member <agent>` is what does.
  Editing the config stops the grant recurring; the demotion is a second step
  and there is an issue open for making the config sufficient on its own. The
  agent must also have registered with a nonce, since
  without one it cannot prove it is itself after a restart, which is the whole
  of what a standing role needs.

  Preconditions were narrow: the attacker had to be on the board already, and
  `[roles]` had to be configured at all, which is not the default. That is why
  this is a changelog entry rather than an advisory.


- **`--board` sent this board's local secret to whatever an `@` named.** A host
  was validated by splitting it, checking its characters and parsing it as a
  URL, and parsing successfully is not parsing to what was validated: everything
  before an `@` is userinfo, so `--board 'trusted.example@evil.example:4777'`
  passed every rule, named `evil.example` as the authority, printed a confident
  recipe and exited zero. The bridge built from it sends the secret in a header,
  and an explicit `http` skips the trust ceremony, so nothing downstream would
  have caught it. The parsed authority is compared against the validated one,
  which catches the shape rather than the character.

- **Two credential checks were wired into the call sites somebody had noticed.**
  They went into `mcp-config`, the `get()` helper and `mcp-stdio`; fifteen other
  places build requests with the shared client, and `await`, `watch`, `monitor`,
  the admin routes, the hook paths and several `doctor` probes went straight
  past both while attaching `X-Dibs-Local`, and sometimes the admin password.
  Both live in the round tripper now, which is the one thing every
  credential-bearing request passes through and cannot be routed around by
  building the request differently. Safety that depends on the next caller
  remembering is a list, not a rule.

- **The pinned signing identity rotated behind the operator, three ways.** The
  CA was regenerated on *every* load failure (missing, unreadable, malformed,
  mismatched, wrong key type), each of which silently replaces the identity
  every joined machine has pinned, so a bad restore locked out the fleet while
  the daemon reported itself healthy, against a README that promises the
  identity changes only when the operator deletes it. Closing that left a second
  hole: a surviving *key* beside a missing certificate, which is what an
  interrupted restore leaves, fell through and overwrote the key. And a third,
  in the preflight that was added to catch the first two: `os.Stat` follows
  links, so a CA symlink whose target is gone reported `ErrNotExist` and read as
  a first run. Absent means first run; either file present is a refusal that
  says what to do, and the absence check does not follow links.

- **The board's own bootstrap link was printed over `http://`.** `dibs web`
  mints the token through the transport resolver and then wrote the URL with a
  hardcoded scheme and the raw listen address, so a board serving HTTPS sent a
  two-minute bearer for a twelve-hour god-view session in a plaintext request,
  readable by a passive observer who can then race to redeem it. It also printed
  `0.0.0.0` for a wildcard bind, which connects from nowhere.

- **The biometric prompt carried text the requesting agent chose.** The release
  claims the sentence on the sheet is daemon-authored, and that is the whole
  basis for "decline anything you did not start". The one variable part is the
  agent's display name, which admission only length-bounds: a newline puts
  attacker text on its own line where it reads as the prompt, a bidirectional
  override reverses everything after it, and a quote closes the name early. It
  is flattened and quoted now, and `SECURITY.md` says what an agent can still
  do, which is pick a misleading name.

- **A coordinator could take the operator's mailbox once they stopped typing.**
  Both mailbox guards asked `humanIdentityLocked`, which answers "who may act as
  the human" and correctly returns nothing for an archived row. Ownership is not
  authority, and they treated an archived human as no human at all: fail-open,
  on the one question where ownership is what matters. The state arrives on its
  own: thirty dormant days archive the human, and the row and its mail outlive
  that by the seven-day retention window, so for a week the operator's private
  mailbox could be adopted directly or by approving a peer's request carrying
  it.

- **A purged agent left its mailbox behind for the next agent of that name.** An
  id is derived from the name, so purging the row after archive retention
  released the id while every message still pointed at it, and whoever
  registered that name next inherited the mail. For the human that name is the
  OS username, which is the one id an attacker can be certain of, and the
  retained mail is the operator's own. Mail *to* the purged agent goes with it;
  mail it *sent* stays, because that inbox belongs to whoever received it.

- **Log redaction protected one destination of two.** The handler redacted its
  copy for `/api/logs` and forwarded the original record to stderr, which is
  where a service manager collects it, so tokens, nonces and message bodies had
  been going there in full. Attributes bound with `log.With` reached the base
  handler before redaction as well. Both destinations, both paths, now. And a
  failed wake no longer logs the command's output at all, because the documented
  wake command runs an entire agent turn and its stdout is transcript,
  decrypted mail, and whatever a tool surfaced. Only the operating system's own
  complaint is logged, and only when the process never started.

- **And then it shipped as something that is not a bundle.** The archive entry
  added to fix the above used a `Dibs.app/**/*` glob, which ate the `Contents`
  level: every archive carried `Dibs.app/MacOS/dibs-notify`, which macOS does
  not recognise as a bundle and which is not the path the runtime resolves, so
  `dibs doctor` run from an extracted archive reported the notifier not
  installed and fell back to `osascript` under Script Editor's name. That is the
  same sentence the fix was written to remove, and three guards were green over
  it: `goreleaser check` validates the file's shape, and the two helper guards
  look for the substring `src: Dibs.app`, which the broken line contains. The
  gate builds the archives and opens one now, and compares it against the paths
  read out of the packages that resolve them.

- **The notifier bundle was never in a release.** `internal/notify` resolves
  `Dibs.app/Contents/MacOS/dibs-notify` beside the executable and only `task
  install` built it, so every published archive and every `brew install` went
  without the one component whose job is putting a notification in front of the
  person, while CI passed on a source build that had it. The Touch ID helper had
  this exact hole one round earlier and its guard watched only itself; the new
  one reads what the *runtime* looks for and checks each against the release.

### Added

- **`[wake] sockets = false`** switches the session-socket routes off: the
  daemon's peer-socket wake and the bridge's self-wake. The guide had promised
  an operator a configuration with no unsolicited activations and named only
  turn extension and the absence of `[wake.exec]` entries, while both socket
  routes stayed on with no switch at all. Now there is one, on by default.
  The bridge reads it at start, and an in-place upgrade is a start: the first
  cut restored the self-wake a previous image was holding, and the notice it
  owed, with no look at the switch, so a bridge that was running when the
  operator turned the route off kept waking its session after it upgraded.

- **An agent that is not running can be woken: `[wake.exec]`.** Mail arrived for
  agents that were not executing, and sat there. Dibs would deliver it at their
  next activation, which for a dormant agent is whenever a human next happens to
  start them, so a question with a ten-minute deadline expired unread and the
  answer looked like a Dibs failure. That is the difference between a message
  bus and a phone.

  An operator may now name, per harness, the command that resumes a thread:

  ```toml
  [wake.exec.codex]
  argv = ["/Applications/ChatGPT.app/Contents/Resources/codex",
          "exec", "resume", "{thread}", "{message}"]
  ```

  `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` records why that command and not `codex queue`, which
  was measured on the same day and wakes a thread only when one is already
  loaded: pointed at a stopped one it returns `Queued message` and nothing
  stirs.

  Dibs runs it when a message that somebody is waiting on lands for an agent it
  has not heard from recently: `question`, `request` and `handoff`, plus the
  verdicts (`approved`, `denied`, `answered`, `declined`) that resolve one. A
  `notify` never wakes anybody, because nobody is waiting on it. `{thread}` is
  the harness's own thread identifier, taken from the agent's session aliases
  and only when it has the shape a resume command accepts. It is deliberately
  NOT the agent's `session_id`: that names the harness process (`host-92368`)
  and dies with it, so an agent whose only identifier is one of those is not
  woken, because there would be nothing to hand the command. Where an agent has
  reattached and holds several, it is the CURRENT one, the thread its harness
  reported most recently, which is recorded as such: resuming an older thread
  would start a real session that is not the one holding the mail. (Until
  round eight this was inferred from append order, and a return to an earlier
  thread left the wake on the later one.)

  Wakes are rate-limited per agent (90s by default, `cooldown =`), so a burst
  never becomes one process per message, and an agent that has made an
  authenticated call inside that window is left alone because it is plainly
  running. Mail that arrives while a command is running is re-asked once when
  that command exits, so a burst is one wake and at most one re-ask: the exit
  asks whether anybody is still waiting, and an agent that answered its mail
  produces nothing. The command itself is bounded at two hours, not at anything shorter:
  `codex exec resume` runs the agent's whole turn in that process, so a short
  bound is a cap on the work rather than on starting it.

  **The operator decides this, not Dibs and not the agent.** There is no default
  command for any harness: with no `[wake.exec]` section nothing is ever
  executed, which is the behaviour of every release before this one. An agent
  cannot ask to be woken by a command of its choosing, and cannot name the
  argv. PHILOSOPHY rule 5 says Dibs does not drive harnesses; this is the
  operator driving their own, through a line they wrote, and `WAKE-MECHANISMS.md`
  records why the earlier shell-hook version was deleted and why this one is not
  the same thing.

- **The Codex plugin binds `hook_poll` to the thread lifecycle, on the
  builds that run it.** `plugins/codex/hooks.json` registers `mcp_tool`
  handlers on SessionStart, Stop and SubagentStop, so a Codex thread that is
  running collects its mail at each of them without polling. Measured against
  a live daemon on the build of the day: three hooks, three deliveries.
  Measured again on 2026-09-05 against codex 0.153.4, CLI and desktop app:
  none of the three fired, which `plugins/codex/README.md` records with the
  date. The file ships; whether it fires depends on the build, which is why
  `dibs://plugin` reports Codex as pull-only and `check_in` remains the floor.
  `[wake.exec]` above is what reaches a thread that is not running, and is
  what was measured working on that same day.

- **The multi-machine board is documented and has a command.** Everything needed
  for a real-time fleet board already shipped; the operator who runs Dibs for
  that reason nearly gave up on it. `dibs mcp-config --board <addr>` prints the
  join config for another machine's board: the data directory, the secret copy,
  the ssh forward, and the config for both harnesses. `README.md` gains a second
  machine section.

  The recipe was in the binary all along and unreachable: it printed only inside
  the TLS branch, so a plaintext loopback daemon (every fresh install) never
  showed it. It prints unconditionally now.

  The **ssh forward is named as a supported transport**. A loopback daemon is
  unreachable from another host and the documented answer was a routable TLS
  endpoint, which excludes the corporate and lab networks full of hosts that will
  never have one. The forward always worked, because the bridge only ever talks
  to an address, and it is the better shape: the daemon never leaves loopback.
  With it, a paragraph on choosing the hub, since that choice decides whether the
  fleet has a board at all and the laptop is the tempting wrong answer.


### Changed

- **No Mac Intel build.** Apple is ending Intel support, so the released macOS
  archive and the Homebrew cask are `arm64` only. Carrying the target costs a
  second Swift slice for each of the two helpers, `lipo` for both, and the
  checking that goes with them, which is where the last two release-artifact
  defects were; paying that every release for a platform on its way out is not
  worth it. **Breaking for anyone installing on an Intel Mac**: build from
  source, which works and is documented, or use `go install` for the two Go
  binaries without the Touch ID and notifier helpers. Linux keeps both `amd64`
  and `arm64`, which is not going anywhere.

- **`dibs.toml` has one type and one loader.** The daemon decoded the file into
  its own struct and refused any key it did not recognise; `dibs mcp-config`,
  which describes the daemon an agent will connect to, decoded a four-field
  projection and checked the rest against a hand-kept list of key NAMES. That
  list validated spelling and nothing else, so `[limits] agent_ttl = 10` passed
  the CLI and produced a configuration while `dibd -check` refused the same
  file: the daemon would not start, and the command telling an operator how to
  reach it reported success. Both now call `internal/boardconfig`, and the
  key-name copy and its drift test are gone with the need for them.


- **The transport advice for another machine was backwards.** "Use the url form
  only from ANOTHER machine" sent operators to a url client for the case where a
  forked identity costs most: a remote session is the long-lived unattended one.
  The url form is now scoped to a client that cannot run a process at all, here
  and in the codex and chatgpt-desktop plugin READMEs.

- **`register` documents both of its continuity paths.** It returns `resumed`
  when the agent was still active and this was a retry, and `reattached` when it
  had stopped and the nonce recovered it. The description named only the second,
  so an integrator testing the obvious way lands on the first, sees neither the
  documented key nor an explanation, and concludes identity continuity is broken.
  Both are named now, with the token rotation on reattach: a client that cached
  the old token is holding a dead one. Paid for inside the tools/list budget
  rather than by raising it.

- **The install nudge no longer repeats on every register.** Only `reattached`
  suppressed it, so a still-active agent re-registering with its nonce came back
  `resumed`, was treated as a first connection, and read the four-sentence
  paragraph again every time.

- **The mail digest now names the call that clears each kind.** The Stop hook
  reported the same unread count at every turn boundary for eight hours while
  the recipient read the messages and moved on, because fetching a body consumes
  nothing and only `ack` closes a `notify`. An agent habituates to a line that
  does not change and then stops looking at one that is sometimes urgent. The
  announcement line in the same function had already learned this and says so in
  its own comment: the way out has to be stated in the same breath. Which call
  clears it depends on the type, so it is not one string. A question or a
  request is closed by answering, and telling an agent to `ack` there would
  teach it to silence somebody who is waiting.

### Added

- **A wake that reaches an idle Claude Code session, with nothing configured.**
  The bridge is a direct child of the session it serves, and the harness hands
  its children `CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET` and `CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_TOKEN`
  for exactly this. A message from a session's own descendants is `selfSent`,
  which the inbound policy ACCEPTS rather than holds, so it lands where the
  daemon's peer-socket route could never reach: a session in bypassPermissions
  mode, which is what an unattended fleet runs in.

  The bridge subscribes to its own agent's inbox over the connection it already
  has (SEP-2575, which Dibs already serves), and on an update puts the same one
  fixed sentence into its own session. No operator configuration, no key file to
  find, no process spawned, no cross-session gate. Verified live: mail sent to
  an agent, and the notice arriving in that session moments later, in bypass
  mode.

  Nothing about the rule changes. It carries no counts, no senders, no body and
  nothing an agent wrote, and it cannot read the session or steer it.

### Fixed

- **A reconnect from the beginning could miss mail the ring had dropped.** A
  subscriber resuming with a cursor of zero has a position, at the start, and a
  ring that has moved past it cannot answer. The read treated zero as "from
  wherever the ring begins", which is the right convenience for a caller that
  has never seen the board and the wrong answer for one that is resuming: it
  succeeded, returned what the ring still held, and reported no gap, so a
  question whose event had already been evicted was never rebuilt from the mail
  and the stream carried on from the present with nothing to announce it.

- **`[wake] sockets = false` is documented as the per-machine setting it is.**
  Each side reads it from its own data directory, so setting it on a hub
  governs the daemon's peer-socket route and leaves a bridge that joined from
  another machine waking its own session as before. The guide described one
  switch covering both routes, which is true on one machine and was silently
  false across two, and `dibs doctor` now says so where it reports that
  configuration.

- **The daemon's own reporting identity could be recovered by name and session
  id.** `dibs` is the row the daemon reports its own faults under, and an agent
  reading "Dibs found a fault" has no way to check who wrote it. That identity
  was reserved against a caller presenting its nonce, but a v0.0.6
  archive-and-recovery blanks the nonce on the row while keeping the index, and
  both the name and the session id are constants in this repository. It is now
  reserved on the same terms as the operator's own row, which no caller
  recovers.

- **Recovering an agent could redirect its wakes to a thread it had left.**
  The guard that decides whether a registration may claim a harness thread asks
  whether the fold will land that registration on the row holding it, and that
  question is answered by one rule for ops this version writes and another for
  older ones. The flag saying which was stamped after the guard ran, so the
  guard judged by the old rule and discarded the thread the harness was
  actually in, while the fold went on to reattach the row by the new one. The
  agent came back reattached with every wake aimed at the previous thread. The
  flag is now stamped before any guard reads it.

- **An agent's guessed-session list grew without bound.** Session aliases are
  capped at eight and the oldest are evicted, but the record of which ones were
  guesses was never evicted with them. A hundred guessed bindings left eight
  aliases and a hundred provenances, most naming ids the agent no longer holds.
  That is replayable state, so it accumulated in the ledger and in every replay
  of it. Eviction now takes the provenance with the alias, for registrations
  that recorded the decision, so a v0.0.6 ledger still replays to the board it
  built.

- **A deferred wake is always delivered.** A notice held back by the cooldown
  was, for several revisions, re-checked locally before delivery and dropped if
  the subscription that armed it looked retired. That check asked a question
  the bridge cannot answer: validity turns on token rotation, a session move, a
  sign-off, a recovery through another bridge and a refusal at the daemon, and
  the check stood on a pointer in a local map that none of those move. Two of
  the revisions dropped notices that were owed, which loses the message
  outright, because the call reports success and the subscription's cursor
  advances past the event. The check is gone. The daemon decides who is woken
  when it sends the notification, and delivering that decision a few seconds
  later is not a fresh claim to re-examine. The cost is that an agent which
  changes session inside one cooldown may see one rate-limited notice in the
  session it just left.

- **A resumed agent was awake, subscribed, and unreachable.** `resume` rotated
  the token and bumped the activation while leaving every session binding
  pointing at the session the agent had just left. An agent that registered in
  one session and resumed from another opened a subscription there that the
  daemon correctly withheld mail from, because the row still belonged
  elsewhere, and the daemon's own wake routes still named the old session. It
  stayed that way until some later call happened to rebind it. Resume now takes
  the session it arrives from, as every other recovery path already did, and
  only for ops that recorded the decision, so a v0.0.6 ledger rebinds nothing.

- **A recovered agent that kept working never got its durable identity back.**
  Archival blanks an agent's nonce while keeping the index that finds it, and
  the repair that puts it back reached only the dormant recovery path. An agent
  that comes back and stays busy is active, so a later registration with the
  same nonce took the live-resume path instead and restored nothing. Its
  fingerprint stayed empty and a role declared in `dibs.toml` could never
  reconcile onto it, for as long as it kept working. Both paths now restore it,
  still only for registrations that recorded the decision, so a v0.0.6 ledger
  replays exactly as before.

- **A rebuilt inbox notice could be dropped as already delivered.** When a
  subscription's cursor falls past the ring, the notices it missed are rebuilt
  from the mail itself. Those carry no sub-serial, so they all land on zero,
  and a stream whose position was already at that serial skipped one as seen.
  An adoption is the case that reaches it: it emits an agent update first and
  the mail event after, so delivering the first and losing the second left the
  rebuilt notice looking delivered while the mail sat in the inbox announcing
  nothing. A rebuilt notice describes what is still owed, so a position can no
  longer prove it was delivered.

- **Moving an agent between threads could silently disable its self-wake.** A
  same-nonce registration can move a live agent to another thread without
  rotating its token, and the bridge replaced a subscription only when the
  token changed. The stream went on telling the daemon it served the thread the
  agent had left, the daemon correctly withheld the inbox from a stream whose
  agent is elsewhere, and the connection stayed open waking nobody. A stream is
  now replaced when either its credential or the session it serves changes.

- **The drift check still misread a service unit whose binary path contains a
  space.** The previous release note claimed upgrade read these paths
  correctly, and only the recovery decision did: planning still used the
  whitespace-excluding parser, so a correct unit was judged drifted and
  reconciliation would rewrite it, discarding operator customisations. Both
  questions now use the one space-aware reader. That reader identifies the
  executable from the key that names it, `ExecStart` for systemd and the first
  entry of `ProgramArguments` for launchd, rather than by looking for a path
  shaped like the daemon's: a unit setting `WorkingDirectory` to a directory
  ending in the daemon's name answered with that instead, and the drift check
  then called a correct unit wrong.

- **An upgrade misread a service unit whose binary path contains a space.**
  The executable was matched with a whitespace-excluding pattern, so
  `/Users/Example User/bin/dibd` read as `/bin/dibd` and a unit naming the
  installed binary looked like one pinning a different build. Recovery then
  abandoned a correct service unit and started an unsupervised process. The
  executable is now read the same way the data directory always has been,
  through the parser that knows both unit formats.

- **A damaged reply told the caller its request had been refused.** A reply the
  daemon began and could not finish, a body cut short mid-JSON or an empty
  5xx, was answered with the refusal wording, which says the request was
  rejected before it was read. The operation may already be ledgered, so that
  advice invited a retry that could duplicate a send. A damaged reply now
  carries the same uncertain-outcome hint an unreachable daemon does: it may or
  may not have been applied, check the board or retry with `op_id`. That covers
  a server error carrying a body too, an HTML or plain-text 502 or 504 from a
  proxy, which can arrive after the daemon has committed. Only a 4xx, which is
  decided before the request is read, still promises that nothing was applied.

### Changed

- **The spec no longer requires a client-generated nonce to register a
  persistent agent.** It has minted one on omission since v0.0.7's identity
  work, and section 4 and the tool table said otherwise, so a client
  implementing the stated contract got conflicting requirements. Both now say a
  nonce is expected, minted when omitted, and weaker than one the client chose.

- **An old wake's exit could mark the current thread finished.** A wake
  command runs the agent's whole turn, so it can outlive the thread it woke:
  one started on thread A, the agent moved to thread B and called in, then A
  exited and its completion recorded the turn as ended, marking B idle. The
  recency guard then let the next blocking message launch a second activation
  on a thread that was running. A wake's exit now ends the turn only when the
  thread it ran on is still the agent's current session.

- **A stale thread's hook could consume the current thread's wake.** A
  lifecycle hook resolves through retained session aliases, so a late Stop
  from a thread the agent had left was handed the mailbox digest and spent a
  pending notify's one-shot wake, and the current thread never heard of it. A
  hook now delivers, and marks a notify woken, only when it fired for the
  agent's current session, the mail otherwise staying for that session to
  receive.

- **An adopted mailbox could be read by taking over the row that adopted it.**
  The session-only recovery guard refuses a row with a pending grant or
  adoption request, but an approved adoption is terminal, so the guard stopped
  matching the instant the mailbox landed on the requester. A caller with the
  requester's public name and session id could then take its token and read
  the adopted mail. A row that has been handed a mailbox is now recovered by
  its nonce, which v0.0.7 mints for every registration.

- **A turn starting after a long idle could still be woken twice.** The
  starting hook retracted the previous turn's stop but recorded no liveness,
  so if the agent's last authenticated call predated the wake cooldown, a
  question arriving before its first call this turn launched the wake command
  against the thread that had just started. A starting hook is now recorded as
  contact, the same standing an authenticated call has.

- **A late hook from a thread the agent left could mark the current one
  finished.** Turn state was recorded against whatever row a lifecycle hook
  resolved to, and the row keeps every thread it was bound to, so a Stop or
  SessionEnd arriving from thread A after the agent moved to thread B
  overwrote B's liveness verdict and let the next blocking message launch a
  second activation on B. A hook now records turn state only when it fired for
  the agent's current session, the same rule the subscription and routing
  paths use.

- **The operator's own identity could be recovered without opening the
  board.** The human's row is registered with a fixed, known nonce and so is
  skipped by session-only recovery, but a v0.0.6 archive-and-recovery blanked
  the nonce on the row while keeping the index, and the blanked row was then
  reachable by name and session id, both public (the human's session id is the
  known nonce). That handed out the human's token and approval of the caller's
  own grant with no Touch ID and no password. The human is now recovered only
  by opening the board.

- **A subscription's catch-up kept waking a session the agent left.** The live
  delivery path re-checks the stream's standing before each notification, but
  the gap replay sent its events on a single check made before replay began, so
  an agent that moved sessions or rotated its token mid-replay still received
  the rest of the gap as inbox wakes for the session it left. The replay now
  re-reads the standing before each event.

- **A pending mailbox adoption could be captured before approval, like a
  pending grant.** Round sixty-one closed the grant case but read only the
  grant field, so a request that moves a whole mailbox onto the requester on
  approval was still open: another caller could take the requester's row by
  its public name and session id, and the operator's yes moved the mailbox
  onto the taker. A row with any pending request that performs something on
  approval, a role grant or an adoption, is now recovered by its nonce alone.

- **An upgrade whose stop failed could restart the old binary and call it
  the new build.** Recovery preferred the service unit and checked only that
  it named the right data directory, not the right executable, so a unit
  still pinning the previous binary (a legacy-labelled one a failed stop
  never let the rewrite reach) brought the old daemon back while the report
  said "This is the NEW build". Recovery now starts directly with the
  installed binary when the unit pins a different one.

- **A pending role grant could be captured before the human approved it.**
  The guard that keeps session-only recovery away from a row bearing power
  covered rows that already held a role, not a default registrant with a
  grant request still awaiting the human's yes. Another caller could
  re-register with the requester's public name and session id, take the
  row's token, and receive the role the operator then approved. A row with
  a pending grant is now recovered by its nonce alone, which v0.0.7 mints
  for every registration, so the requester itself still returns.

- **A subscription that dropped its first serial lost the mail on it.** The
  overflow refill re-read its position by decrementing it and asking the
  engine for events after that serial; a position of one decremented to
  zero, which the engine reads as "give me the whole ring", so a first
  serial that had left the ring took its unread mail with it and the resync
  that would have recovered it never ran. The refill now reads from its
  genuine position, and a position the ring has passed resyncs from the
  mail.

- **A bridge's self-wake followed its agent into another session.** A
  subscription captured its agent when it opened and delivered for as long
  as the socket stayed up, so a bridge left behind by an identity that moved
  to a second session kept waking the first, which the daemon's own wake
  routes never do; and a stream opened with a token later rotated away went
  on delivering the new holder's mail. The bridge's listen now names the
  session it serves (`_meta["com.dibs/session"]`: the thread the harness
  named on its tool calls, else the bridge's own session id), the daemon
  withholds the inbox from a stream whose agent is in another session and
  feeds it again when the agent returns, and a stream ends with its
  credential. A stated thread counts as held only while it is the agent's
  current session, since the row retains every thread it has been bound to;
  a stream following the board alone answers to no credential and is not
  measured against one.

- **A restored pending wake bypassed the session's cooldown.** The in-place
  upgrade delivered the notice the old image owed through a waker of its
  own, beside the one the restored streams write through, so a notification
  arriving during the restore put two interruptions into the session at
  once. The owed notice goes through the watcher's waker.

- **An empty or truncated daemon reply left a bridge call hanging.** A
  refusal with an empty body, a proxy's 502 or a daemon mid-restart's 503,
  produced no line at all, and a body cut short mid-JSON was forwarded as
  malformed JSON; neither is a response the harness can match to its
  request. Both become a JSON-RPC error carrying the request id, and a read
  that fails is answered as an unreachable daemon is.

- **The self-wake cooldown was per mailbox, not per session.** Each
  watched agent's stream had a waker of its own, so two mailboxes receiving
  questions put two interruptions into the same session socket microseconds
  apart, against the fifteen-second cooldown the session is promised. Every
  stream writes through one waker; a second arrival inside the cooldown is
  deferred to its end, not dropped.

- **Moving a live identity to a new session kept the old activation's
  acknowledgement.** A same-nonce register inside the TTL that moved the row
  to a new session left the awareness gate armed by the previous activation,
  so the new one could claim without a `check_in`. A move re-arms the gate,
  as the other two recovery paths already did.

- **An identical retry that stated a primary beside a thread alias was
  ledgered every time.** The resume path decided whether an op changed
  anything by comparing fields one at a time, and a synthetic primary is
  never the current session while a thread alias is, so the shape the bridge
  sends read as a change on every call. The decision now asks the fold's
  own rule what the op would leave current.

- **The board's own origin was refused on a default port.** Browsers
  serialise an origin without the scheme's default port, so a board served
  on 80 or 443 compared an empty port with its own: navigation loaded the
  page and every authenticated action got 403. Both sides are read with the
  default filled in.

- **A plain `check_in` could replace a stated thread with a directory
  guess.** The ingress inferred a session by directory whenever the op
  itself carried no session fields, without asking whether the row already
  held a stated thread: an agent that registered stating thread A, in a
  directory another session had announced from, was bound to that session
  on its next `check_in`, the wake resumed the wrong thread and that
  session's hooks resolved to A's mailbox. No guess is made over a stated
  thread the row holds, which is what the earlier entry already promised.

- **The session-ordering test never went through ingress.** It tested the
  announcement and the claim rule separately, so removing the guard that
  prefers a supplied session over the directory guess left it passing. A
  case submits the call through ingress and checks which id the row holds.

- **Reclaiming a guessed alias took the owner's stated primary with it.**
  An active owner held a stated synthetic primary and a thread alias the
  daemon had inferred for it; a newcomer stating both reclaimed the guess,
  which is right, and the alias's holder had been recorded as authority over
  both ids, so the owner lost its stated primary and its hooks went to the
  newcomer. The alias's holder is recorded in its own field only, and the
  fold drops each id on the field written for it.

- **`dibs upgrade` compared dirty development builds as equal.** A local
  build reports `devel+<revision>.dirty`, and two builds of one revision with
  different uncommitted edits carry the same string: rebuilding and
  installing was told nothing to do while the old daemon went on serving.
  A version that is not a released build never compares equal.

- **Registering a second agent through a bridge retired the first one's
  self-wake.** The bridge's inbox watcher held one token and replaced it on
  every registration, so with two agents sharing one bridge only the last
  registered mailbox kept its self-wake. The watcher keeps one stream per
  agent, keyed by the agent the reply names; a rotated token replaces only
  its own agent's stream and keeps its cursor; the in-place upgrade handoff
  carries every stream, and still writes the single fields for an image that
  predates them.

- **The Codex plugin's verification checked bookkeeping, not delivery.**
  It told readers to verify the hooks by a peer seeing `state == finished`
  in `spawned_agents`; that state is recorded when the hook call arrives,
  before anything is delivered, so the check passes when the hook reaches
  Dibs and its output never reaches the model, which is the silent failure
  it was meant to catch. The check says what it proves, and adds the one
  that proves delivery: a question sent between turns whose digest is in
  the next turn's context before any call is made.

- **A newcomer sharing a bridge session took over its hooks.** Every agent
  registering through one bridge states the same `host-<ppid>`, on purpose,
  and among several active stated holders the hook lookup preferred the
  lowest id: an agent registered later under a name that sorted first
  redirected the hooks of the agent that had the session first, which kept
  its binding and lost its routing. Among active stated holders the one that
  held the id first wins; the lowest id decides only between rows created at
  once.

- **The upgrade's "nothing to do" asked the wrong daemon.** It queried the
  daemon at DIBS_ADDR, and the daemon the plan replaces is the registry's:
  with the target on an older build and another configured board on the new
  one, it concluded nothing to do and left the target alone. The plan asks
  the daemon it recorded, at the address and scheme it recorded; a query
  that fails proceeds to the cutover.

- **A board-only subscriber past the ring was never told the board
  changed.** The overflow refill returned nothing when the position had
  fallen outside the ring and the subscriber followed only `dibs://board`,
  with its loss mark already cleared, so it stayed on a stale board until the
  next change happened to reach it. The refill sends one board notice; the
  board resource is a snapshot, so that is all such a subscriber needs.

- **The upgrade's "nothing to do" compared the wrong binary.** The check
  that stops an upgrade when the daemon already serves the installed build
  compared the daemon's version with the CLI's, and the replacement daemon
  is a binary of its own: a CLI and daemon on one build with a newer `dibd`
  installed beside them was told nothing to do, and the new daemon never
  ran. The check reads the version the installed daemon reports for itself
  when the preflight asks it to rebuild the board.

- **A second adoption announced the first one's mail again.** The event
  filter matched the source and the heir and never asked when the move
  happened, so adopting a source a second time emitted `message.adopted` for
  every message an earlier adoption had moved, presenting old mail as a new
  blocking arrival to the subscription and the wake. Only what this
  adoption moved is announced.

- **The board page showed "No mail" when the mailbox could not be read.**
  A refused or failed mail fetch returned silently under a live mark, so a
  valid session with no page key saw an empty, live-looking mailbox while
  `/api/messages` answered 401. The pane says the mailbox could not be read
  and why, keeps the last good view, and says what to do. The first cut said
  so only over an empty mailbox: once one fetch had succeeded, a later
  refusal kept the cached mail and hid the warning, under a stream still
  labelled live. The warning sits above whatever is cached.

- **`dibs upgrade` restarted a fleet that was already on the build.** The
  help said a bare run on an up-to-date install does nothing, and the command
  stopped the serving daemon and restarted it onto the build it was on. When
  the daemon reports the build this CLI was installed with, and nothing about
  the service unit needs repair, it says so and stops.

- **The reattach path's activation rule applied to historical ops.** A
  v0.0.6 reattach with a new thread alias and no pid kept the recorded
  process; replayed under the new rule it rebuilt a different one, losing
  crash detection for that agent after an upgrade. The rule is gated on the
  recorded semantics, as it already was on the other two recovery paths.

- **Reattaching by session id kept the other thread's process.** A
  persistent agent that had moved from thread A to B, recovered by name and
  its retained session id A with no pid stated, was put back on A with B's
  process still on the row; when B exited the sweep retired it. The reattach
  path applies the activation rule the other two recovery paths apply: a
  stated thread that is not the current session is a move even when the row
  holds it as its primary, and the bridge's own non-thread id is not.

- **A sibling taking two bindings left an active holder behind.** A register
  minting a sibling with an active agent's token takes that agent's thread
  alias; when the same register stated a primary held by a dormant row, the
  ingress recorded only the dormant row as the one the take came from, so the
  alias stayed on the active row too: two active holders of one thread. The
  first fix dropped it on the caller's token, which the ledger does not
  carry, so a restart rebuilt the two holders and a state that was not the
  fold of its ledger. The ingress records the alias's holder in a field of
  its own (`session_alias_taken_from`, added to the frozen list), and the
  fold drops on that, on replay as live.

- **A minted nonce did not close the guessable recovery path, and nothing
  said so.** SECURITY.md said an agent registered with a nonce requires it;
  every persistent registration is now handed one, and a nonce Dibs minted
  leaves the row reclaimable by name and session id, deliberately. The
  document says which nonces protect, and the registration result tells a
  minted-nonce agent it stays reclaimable, without advising a re-register
  that would fork a sibling.

- **Approving an old adoption request could still take a successor's
  mailbox.** The purge written by this version expires a pending request
  naming the purged agent; a sweep written before v0.0.7 leaves it standing,
  and replay must not change that, so a request sent shortly before such a
  purge survives an upgrade and its `adopt` name resolves at approval against
  the roster of the day. Approval now refuses a target registered after the
  request was sent: it is not the agent the request concerned.

- **Returning to a thread bound earlier kept the wrong process.** Threads A,
  B, A: the return was a session the row still held, so it was read as the
  same activation as B, B's process stayed on the row and A's stated location
  was discarded. A thread that is not the current session is a move, whether
  or not the row has seen it before.

- **A purge's expiry events replayed in map order.** The purge walks the
  messages and now emits an event per adoption request it expires; two
  requests naming the purged mailbox took their sub indices from Go's
  iteration order, so the same ledger rebuilt the same state under a
  different audit stream. The walk is in serial order.

- **The role handover error left the predecessor's role standing.** When a
  pinned role's name is held by a different agent, the error named the three
  steps that let the successor in and called them all of them; none takes
  the role away from the predecessor, which may still be registered under
  another name with its grant in the ledger. The error names the revoke
  first, as the guide and the neighbouring branches already did.

- **A pending adoption request outlived the mailbox it named.** The purge
  retired a purged agent's outgoing mail and dropped its incoming mail, and
  left standing any request whose `adopt` named the purged id; approval
  resolves that name against the current roster, so approving it after a
  stranger had registered the released name moved the stranger's mail. The
  purge expires such requests, with a reason that says so.

- **Re-registering through the same bridge dropped the bound thread.** A
  register whose session id and alias are both the bridge's own id was read
  as a new activation, which is right for a bridge that restarted and wrong
  for the same bridge registering again inside its TTL: the thread its hooks
  had bound stopped being the one to wake until something rebound it. Each
  recovery path now says whether the op's session was already held before
  it ran, and the same activation naming its own id does not displace a
  thread.

- **A recovery from a new session kept the old process.** A same-name
  register with its nonce from a new session moved the row to that session
  and kept the pid and working directory of the activation that had ended;
  the next liveness sweep found that process dead and retired the agent
  that had just come back, and the board placed it where it used to be. On
  both recovery paths, a live row resumed and a dormant row recovered, a new
  activation takes the pid and location the op states, and a pid it does
  not state is unknown rather than inherited. A new activation is a new
  session id or a new thread alias, because the bridge reports a Codex
  thread as the alias and may state no session id at all.

- **Doctor diagnosed a remote board's wake routes from the local file.** A
  joining machine runs it against the hub with a data directory of its own,
  and the wake check read that directory's dibs.toml as the hub's
  configuration: "no wake command is configured" against a hub that had
  several, with a repair that edits a file the hub never reads. When the
  board's node id is not this directory's, the check says whose board it is
  and sends the operator to the machine that runs it.

- **Doctor said the socket route is tried first while it was switched
  off.** With `[wake] sockets = false` and no `[wake.exec]` command, neither
  route runs, which is the configuration the guide describes for no
  unsolicited activations; the check called that unconfirmed delivery. It
  says no route at all, and what that configuration asks for.

- **Hidden predecessor mail still authorised its attachments.** A blob is
  fetchable by the recipient of a message referencing it, and that route did
  not ask whose mail the message was: below the watermark it was addressed
  to a previous occupant of the id, the replacement could not see it, and
  could still fetch its attachment by blob id. The route applies the mail
  fence Inbox applies, adopted mail included. The third door after the two
  closed in the previous rounds.

- **Doctor told an unconfigured harness to re-register.** With a wake
  command configured for one harness and an agent of another holding a
  resumable thread, the report assumed that having no built-in suggestion
  for that harness meant it already had a command, and advised registering
  through its plugin, which cannot supply configuration. It now says which
  harnesses have no command, pastes a block for the ones it knows and a
  template for the ones it does not, and reserves the no-thread advice for
  harnesses that do have one.

- **A name purged by a pre-v0.0.7 sweep still handed its attachments to
  the next registrant.** Replay preserves that sweep as it was, ownership
  included, and no later sweep can repair it because the row is gone. A
  registration fences the predecessor's mail already; it now also strips the
  id from every blob, because a fresh row has put nothing and any ownership
  under its id is a predecessor's. The previous entry covered new purges
  only.

- **A daemon bound to an IP refused a certificate issued for its name.** The
  startup check verified the configured certificate against the listening
  address, so a daemon bound to `10.0.0.9:4777` whose clients dial
  `https://hub.example:4777` was refused at start and at `-check` for a
  certificate that is correct for every client. A certificate that names no
  address but names a DNS host is accepted on an IP listener; one that names
  only other addresses is still refused.

- **An upgrade dropped the transport a daemon was launched with.** A daemon
  started with `-addr https://127.0.0.1:4777` registered the bare listener,
  and the upgrade, which rebuilds the replacement's argv from the registry,
  restarted it with a bare address the replacement re-inferred: an https
  loopback board came back plaintext and every client lost it. The registry
  carries the scheme the daemon was asked for, and the upgrade hands it back.

- **A self-wake retry fired after a delivery had succeeded.** A retry armed
  by a failed delivery, or a notice deferred to the cooldown, stayed armed
  past a delivery that succeeded in the meantime: the socket came back, the
  next arrival was delivered, and the timer put a second notice into the
  session with no mail behind it. A successful delivery disarms the retry;
  it is the notice the timer would have given. Only the retry: a notice
  deferred to the cooldown stands for an arrival that came in while the
  earlier notice was on the wire, and the first cut of this disarmed that
  too, losing the newer mail's notice.

- **The tool schema promised that a notify never wakes or costs anything.**
  Under the default `extend_turn_for = all` a fresh notify at Stop extends
  the recipient's turn, which the wake-urgency test asserts and the changelog
  already says. The schema says a notify may extend a turn and never starts
  an idle agent, within the listing's budget.

- **A purged name's replacement inherited its attachments.** The purge drops
  the row's mail and retires its outgoing mail, and left every blob the agent
  had put naming its id as an owner; ownership is an authorisation on its
  own, so a stranger registering the purged name could fetch the
  predecessor's attachments for as long as a peer's message kept a blob
  alive. The purge strips the id from every blob it owned, under the same
  flag. An older exposure the purge hardening had left open, not a new one.

- **A stream's overflow refill could skip the rest of a serial.** One op
  emits several events at one serial and the channel drops one event at a
  time: the first event of a check_in was delivered and moved the position
  to its serial, the message.delivered events after it at the same serial
  were dropped, and the refill asked for strictly later serials and
  recovered none. The position is the event, not the serial, and a refill
  re-reads the position's serial and skips only what it delivered.

- **The bridge's own session id displaced a stated thread.** The bridge
  sends its `host-<ppid>` as an alias on every call. A register that stated
  its thread was made current on that alias instead, and even once the thread
  was current, the next check_in re-bound the alias and made it current
  again, so the configured wake had no thread to resume one call after
  gaining one. A thread beats a synthetic id: a stated thread is current over
  a non-thread alias, and a synthetic id already held does not displace a
  thread. A NEW synthetic id is a new activation and still takes over.

- **Recovering a row by name and session id lost its wake route.** A
  register carrying neither token nor nonce was refused the thread alias an
  active row already held, then reattached to that very row: the fold took
  the synthetic host id as current, the thread the row still held was no
  longer the one to wake, and the configured route stood down until an
  authenticated call bound it again. A register that lands on the row holding
  the alias is re-asserting its own thread, and keeps it.

- **The Claude Code plugin said a notify never extends a turn.** Under the
  default `extend_turn_for = all` a fresh notify at Stop does, which is what
  the wake-urgency test asserts; only `urgent` holds it for a boundary the
  agent reaches on its own. Both places the plugin said it are corrected.

- **Correcting a location without moving discarded the re-resolved
  repository.** `update(cwd)` applied the location group only when the cwd
  differed, so an agent that registered before `git init`, or whose
  repository changed its remote, corrected with the same directory, the
  ingress resolved the new repository, and the fold discarded it and reported
  success with the old identity. The group applies when any of its fields
  differ, and `changed` says `repo` when only the derived half moved.

- **The tunnel recipe told a TLS loopback daemon's joiner to use plaintext.**
  The paragraph described every loopback daemon as plaintext and put a bare
  `127.0.0.1:<local-port>` in DIBS_ADDR, after the block above it had handed
  over an https:// address for a daemon with a certificate pair; a bare
  address makes the bridge infer plaintext, and the trust step cannot change
  what it inferred. The paragraph names the transport the daemon serves and
  the same address the block above gives. The same output carried a third
  copy of the url-client claim corrected last round; it is corrected too.

- **A resumed subscription's replay was charged to the agent's rate budget.**
  Opening the stream spends one token, and the gap replay read the ring as the
  agent, spending another: when the listen took the last one the replay got
  E_RATE_LIMITED, an error was an empty gap, and the acknowledged stream
  proceeded from the present past a pending question. The replay and the
  inbox resync are the daemon's own work for a subscriber it already
  authenticated, and read the ring the way the daemon does.

- **The generated client configuration repeated the url-client claim.** Both
  `dibs join` and the url-form output said a url client holds no nonce, so
  every reconnect forks an identity, after the README had been corrected. They
  say what the README says: `register` hands back a nonce on every transport,
  the bridge keeps it for the session, and a url client that drops it forks a
  sibling.

- **A burst during a resumed subscription's replay could drop a question
  silently.** The live channel holds 256 events and the loop drops rather
  than stalls when it is full; a resumed subscription writes its replay before
  it drains the channel, so fleet events during a slow replay filled it and a
  question that arrived after them was in neither the replay nor the stream.
  The channel now says when it dropped, and the stream refills from the ring
  everything after the last serial it delivered; a repeat coalesces where a
  loss did not.

- **A restart could wake an agent to read mail the boot sweep had just
  deleted.** Blocking notices are rebuilt at construction, before the boot
  sweep, and the sweep deletes consumed terminal mail past its retention: an
  answered request older than that produced a notice and lost its message a
  moment later, so the agent was woken, told to `read_mail(N)`, and answered
  E_NO_MESSAGE on every restart. Notices pointing at mail the state no longer
  holds are dropped after every sweep.

- **The socket route could wake the activation an agent had left.** It took
  the first address it found among every session the agent had ever answered
  to, so an agent that moved from A to B, with B publishing no socket and A's
  still open, was woken at A; a delivery ends the attempt, and B stayed
  asleep on its mail. When the current activation is known it is the only
  address tried, as the exec route already does.

- **The replay-window regression test did not put its arrival in the
  window.** It sent the question after the listen opened and hoped the replay
  was still running; against the old order it passed whenever the replay
  finished first. The server has a replay seam for tests, and the test sends
  inside it.

- **The remote guide said a url client cannot keep its identity.** It claimed
  a url client holds no nonce, so every reconnect forks an identity;
  `register` hands back a minted nonce on every transport, and a url client
  that keeps it reattaches with the same call. The guide says what the bridge
  adds instead: keeping the nonce for the session across restarts and
  upgrades, and following a daemon restart by itself.

- **The resync past the ring rebuilt only incoming mail.** Two other things
  are owed in the same gap: the verdict on a question or request the agent
  itself sent, which belongs to the sender's side and carries the question's
  older serial, and blocking mail an adoption moved in, whose own serial
  predates the move. Both are rebuilt, from the mail, as the events the ring
  would have carried.

- **A question sent while a reconnect's gap was being replayed could reach
  neither the replay nor the stream.** The live channel opened after the
  replay and from the cursor, so its catch-up pushed the whole gap into a
  buffer that drops when full; a long gap filled it with history already
  replayed, and an arrival during the replay landed past it. The channel
  opens first, from the present, and buffers what arrives while the replay
  runs.

- **The skills guide told the wrong agent to release a session.** It
  recommended `update(release_session: true)` when hooks quoting your session
  reach somebody else; that clears only the caller's own bindings and leaves
  the other agent's standing, so the repair repaired nothing. The guide says
  who holds it, how to claim it back from a holder that is not active or only
  guessed the id, and that an active holder that stated it must release.

- **A subscription that resumed past the ring lost its wakes.** A cursor older
  than the ring got an empty replay after the acknowledgment, so a question
  that arrived while the subscriber was away and whose event had since left
  the ring sat in the inbox with no notice and no signal that one was missed.
  The inbox says what is still owed: each waiting message after the cursor is
  replayed as the notice the ring would have carried.

- **A replacement could acknowledge or answer its predecessor's mail.** The
  mailbox fence hides a previous occupant's mail from a name that comes back
  and read_mail refuses the body, and ack and respond authorised on the
  reused id alone: the replacement could ack a notify it never saw, sending
  its sender a receipt, or answer a question by serial. Both are refused at
  ingress, so the acknowledgements already on disk replay as they were
  accepted.

- **The message-type guidance did not know about the wake routes.** It told
  a sender that a question, request or handoff reaches the recipient at a
  turn boundary or its next Dibs call, which is what an agent uses to choose
  a type and a deadline; with `[wake.exec]` configured or a session socket
  published, an idle recipient is started or nudged for those three. The
  guidance says so, and is shorter than it was.

- **A bridge upgrade wake could resume the thread an agent had left.** A
  persistent agent recovered by nonce from a new `host-<ppid>` activation
  still held the uuid of the activation it left; the wake's newest-alias scan
  found it and `codex exec resume` ran against a real thread, the wrong one,
  while the activation waiting for its mail stayed asleep. When the session
  the harness reported last is not a thread, no thread is known for the
  current activation and the exec route stands down until one is bound.

- **The no-shell guard did not read inside quotes.** It removes quoted
  arguments before matching, because prose in a help string is not control
  flow, and a double-quoted argument that carries a command substitution is
  still executed: `go run ./tools/x "$(printf y)"` passed. A double-quoted
  argument that expands is read; a single-quoted one is not, because the
  shell expands nothing there.

- **A refusal from the daemon's gate corrupted the bridge's stdio.** The gate
  answers a request it will not read with a status and a line of text, and
  the bridge wrote that line to stdout as if it were JSON-RPC: the harness
  got `unauthorized`, no reply carrying its request id, and a call that never
  returned. Shipped in v0.0.6. A body that is not JSON-RPC is delivered as a
  JSON-RPC error with the status, the text and a hint, and a refused
  notification produces nothing, as JSON-RPC says.

- **Adopting a mailbox told the heir nothing.** Both adoption paths emitted
  `agent.updated`, which names no recipient, so a coordinator recovering
  pending questions into a dormant agent got success and neither wake route
  nor the inbox subscription told that agent its recovered mail was waiting.
  Adoption emits one `message.adopted` event per recovered blocking message,
  addressed to the heir, and the wake rule treats it as arrived mail.

- **A resumed subscription could wake twice for one message.** The daemon
  replays the gap filtered and then subscribes from the same cursor, so a
  notice already delivered arrived again and the bridge queued a second wake
  at the cooldown whether or not the agent had read the mail. The bridge
  wakes once per serial.

- **A notify could overfill a mailbox by displacing a predecessor's
  invisible one.** Capacity excludes a previous occupant's mail below the
  watermark; displacement did not, so a notify to a full mailbox evicted a
  fenced predecessor notify, freed no counted slot, and landed anyway, one
  over the cap for every such notify left behind. Displacement picks only
  from the mail that counts.

- **A private panel fetch still lost message bodies and choices.** The
  merge that fills a redacted card from the readable copy beside it read the
  nested `inbox.messages` shape from both carriers, and the panel carrier
  sends `inbox` as a bare array, so on the production shape the merge handed
  the redacted copy back untouched: a request with its Approve button and no
  reason, a question with no choices. The merge reads either shape and
  returns the one it was given; the browser test now uses the production
  shape.

- **A deferred self-wake whose delivery failed could be lost across an
  upgrade.** The deferred callback cleared the handoff's "a notice is owed"
  mark before it tried, and a delivery that failed there armed a retry
  without setting it again: an in-place upgrade in that window carried
  nothing owed, the timer died with the old image, and the cursor had passed
  the event. The mark follows the timer.

- **Upgrade recovery gave up on the case its retry loop exists for.** After a
  stop that timed out the old daemon may still hold the directory lock, the
  replacement exits on it at once, and the start now reports that as an
  error; recovery returned on that error before reaching the loop that starts
  again while the old process drains. A start that fails at once is an
  attempt, paced, and counted against the same bound.

- **A failed human role grant suppressed the configured one.** The record
  that a person set an agent's role was written before the grant applied, so
  a grant to a name not yet registered failed and left the record standing;
  when the agent registered inside the startup window, the reconciler skipped
  its configured grant as already decided. The record is written when the
  grant applied.

- **A deferred first wake that failed got no retry.** The retry path treated
  every execution as the already-retried one, and a first attempt arriving
  there deferred (a recency window, a boot rearm) that failed left no timer:
  one execution instead of the promised two, and pending mail waited for
  another event or a restart. Executions are counted per owed mail, and the
  first gets its retry whichever path ran it.

- **A `dibs.toml` that was a symlink to nothing read as no configuration.**
  The defaults quietly replaced the configured address, the CLI's own
  readability guard passed, and the directory's secret went to whatever
  answered at the default. A dangling link is refused by name.

- **The Codex fallback could report a wake that parked the message.** The
  fallback ran after any primary failure, and `codex queue` exits 0 on a
  closed thread while parking the message where nothing reads it, so a
  resume that failed for some other reason counted as a wake and cancelled
  the retry. The fallback runs only when the primary's output says the
  thread is open; the guide says so.

- **An in-place bridge upgrade could lose a deferred self-wake.** A second
  arrival inside the cooldown defers its notice to a timer and reports
  success, so the reconnect cursor moves past the event; an upgrade before
  the timer fired carried the cursor and not the debt, and the new image put
  nothing into the session. The handoff says a notice is owed and the next
  image delivers it.

- **`extend_turn_for = "none"` claimed more than it governs.** The guide said
  Dibs becomes strictly pull-shaped; the `[wake.exec]` and session-socket
  routes are separate settings and run whatever it says. The guide says what
  the setting governs and what to leave unconfigured for no activations at
  all.

- **A register carrying the holder's token could mint a second live holder
  of its thread.** The session-theft guard let the holder through by its
  token before asking whether the registration landed on that row; a
  register with a fresh name and nonce, the token, and the thread minted a
  sibling that shared it. Two live holders, a coin flip on every hook, and
  two mailboxes waking one session. The thread moves to the row the caller
  is minting, on the stated id and the alias alike.

- **An ambient session repair could overwrite a binding made meanwhile.**
  The repair asked "unbound?" in one trip through the writer loop and bound
  in another; a `check_in` between them bound the real session, which the
  repair then overwrote and ledgered, so the wrong binding survived replay.
  The bind carries `bind_if_unbound` (a frozen tag) and the fold decides
  both at once.

- **A re-registration advanced the self-wake cursor past unseen mail.**
  The watcher took the serial of every register or resume reply as its
  cursor; with a cursor at 10, an unseen question at 11 and a registration
  at 12, the next subscription skipped the question. A reply's serial seeds
  a watcher with no cursor and never advances one.

- **A setting the bridge did not know made the transport a guess.** The
  shared acceptance lets an older bridge read a newer daemon's `dibs.toml`
  past a setting it does not know; the transport resolver rejected the same
  error and fell back to guessing, so `insecure_plaintext` and the TLS
  settings it had parsed were dropped and the CLI dialled https at a
  plaintext board. The resolver reads what it parsed.

- **SPEC.md still said wake-on-mail was future work.** It described mail to a
  dormant agent as waiting for its next activation and listed the supervisor
  glue as v1.1; `[wake.exec]` and the session-socket route shipped this
  cycle. The specification describes the capability boundary that exists.

- **Self-wake lost mail that arrived before its first subscription.** The
  watcher read the registration reply's token and not its serial, so it
  subscribed with no cursor and the daemon started it at the present: a
  question that arrived between registering and the first successful
  subscription woke nobody. The watcher starts from the reply's serial.

- **A failed self-wake consumed its notification.** The bridge advanced its
  reconnect cursor before putting the notice into the session, so a notice
  the socket refused was gone: the reconnect excluded the event and nothing
  retried, and a socket that came back found the agent asleep on stored
  mail. The cursor moves when the notice lands, and a failed notice is
  retried at the cooldown.

- **The configuration guide described the superseded thread rule.** It said
  `{thread}` is the newest alias and can never come from `session_id`; the
  wake prefers the session the harness reported last, accepts a
  thread-shaped `session_id`, and a return to an earlier thread makes that
  one current. The guide says so.

- **A directory guess overrode a stated wake target.** A register that
  named its thread by `session_id` was still given the directory's inferred
  session as an alias, the alias became current, and the configured wake
  resumed the guessed thread. No guess is made over a stated thread.

- **The explicit-session guard refused recovery from a guessed binding.**
  A holder that had only inferred an id kept it against an agent registering
  with that id stated, with `E_SESSION_TAKEN`, while the same claim by alias
  went through. A guessed holder yields to a stated claim on both paths.

- **Nonce recovery left a confirmed session stealable.** Recovering a
  dormant row with `register(name, nonce, session_id)` restored it and kept
  the session it had held as an inference recorded as a guess, so a
  stranger's metadata could take it through ordinary ingress and hooks and
  wakes resolved to the stranger. A stated session id is not a guess, on
  every path that reattaches.

- **A resuming subscription's acknowledgment named the present, not the
  cursor.** The bridge saves the serial the acknowledgment names; sent
  before the gap was replayed, it made a drop between the two skip the gap
  on the next reconnect for good. The acknowledgment names the cursor the
  replay starts from.

- **A second socket miss abandoned outstanding mail.** The retry armed for a
  stale socket cache gave up when it missed again, while the question stayed
  pending; a socket that appeared later was refreshed into the cache and
  the mail never reconsidered. The retry keeps deciding at the refresh
  cadence for as long as blocking mail is outstanding.

- **A reconnect catch-up could still lose the notification that mattered.**
  The subscription replayed the gap through a bounded channel and dropped
  what did not fit before anything was filtered, so a backlog of unrelated
  board events crowded out the one inbox notification that would have woken
  the agent, on a connection that looked healthy. The events addressed to the
  agent are replayed from the ring first, filtered, in full.

- **Correcting an agent's location started no discovery of it.** `update(cwd)`
  updated the row and left the corrected repository unindexed, so semantic
  matching stayed unavailable for the place the agent actually works. A
  correction is discovered as a registration is.

- **The configuration guide's first Codex recipe left open desktop threads
  unreachable.** It showed `codex exec resume` alone and said it works whether
  or not the thread is open; the guide's own later section explains that an
  open desktop thread refuses it and needs the `queue` fallback. The first
  recipe carries the fallback and says why.

- **Confirming an inferred session by registering left it a guess.** A
  same-nonce register that stated the session id the row already held as an
  inference read as no change, so the guess stood and another agent's
  metadata could still take the active session, hooks and wakes with it. A
  guess confirmed is a change, and a confirmed session is stated.

- **An in-place bridge upgrade dropped the self-wake cursor.** The handoff
  carried the watcher's token and not the serial it had last seen, so the
  replacement subscribed from the present and mail arriving during the
  upgrade woke nobody. The cursor travels with the token.

- **A send to `coordinator` carried no pull-only warning.** The engine
  resolves the role address into the holder's id, and the warning looked up
  the literal, which named no agent: a question to an unwakeable coordinator
  returned ok and a deadline with no word that nothing would wake it. The
  warning reads the recipient the engine resolved.

- **The inferred-session guard skipped itself when inference broke.** Its
  setup check called `t.Skip` when the inference had not bound the session,
  so disabling inference turned the test off and the suite exited zero. It
  fails.

- **A live resume discarded a stated `session_id`.** A same-nonce register
  inside the TTL decided whether anything changed from the alias the daemon
  joins alone, so one that stated `session_id: B` with no alias returned
  `resumed: true` and kept thread A: the ingress had accepted the request
  and the fold dropped the one thing it asked for. A stated session id is a
  change, is taken, and is the one to wake.

- **A self-wake stream that dropped before any mail reconnected blind.**
  The cursor came from the first inbox notification, and the acknowledgment
  carried none, so a subscription opened on an empty inbox that dropped
  before a question arrived reconnected at the current serial and the
  question woke nobody. The acknowledgment names the serial the
  subscription starts from, and the bridge reconnects with it.

- **The specification said ephemeral by default and sixteen persistent
  agents.** Both changed this cycle; the changelog said so and SPEC.md did
  not. It says persistent by default with a minted nonce, and a persistent
  ceiling that matches `max_agents`.

- **A returning agent was refused its own thread.** The ingress vets the
  alias a call carries against the caller's token, and a returning agent
  registers with its nonce and no token: it read as a stranger, the alias
  was cleared, and a return from thread B to an earlier thread A left B
  current and the wake on it. The caller is the holder by its nonce as well.

- **A self-wake subscription that reconnected lost the gap.** The stream
  reconnects two seconds after it drops and the daemon started every
  subscription at the current serial, so a message that arrived in between
  woke nobody until the next one came. The inbox notification now carries
  the serial of the event that changed it (`com.dibs/serial`), the bridge
  reconnects with the last one it saw (`com.dibs/since` on the listen
  request), and the daemon replays the gap from its ring.

- **The frozen-tag guard only read one way.** It checked that every
  declared tag was on the frozen list and not that every frozen tag was
  still declared, so a field retired to `json:"-"` left the list and its
  fingerprint untouched while every ledger holding it replayed with that
  decision zero. Both lists are checked both ways, ops and messages.

- **The README described a CA replacement the daemon refuses.** It said
  deleting `tls-ca.pem` changes the signing identity; with `tls-ca-key.pem`
  left behind the daemon refuses to start rather than mint half an identity.
  The README says to delete the pair together, and why.

- **Recovering by session id left the wake on the thread the agent had
  left.** Session-based recovery (a name and a session id, for a row whose
  nonce was minted) reattached and bound only the alias the daemon joins at
  ingress; a register that stated `session_id: B` with no alias reattached
  an agent holding B and C and left C current, so the next wake resumed C.
  The id a caller recovers by is the activation it is on, unless the harness
  reported one.

- **An in-place bridge upgrade switched off self-wake until the next
  register.** The handoff to the new image carried the handshake and the
  caller's subscriptions and not the self-wake watcher's token, so an
  upgraded bridge answered every call and never put another notice into its
  session until the agent happened to register or resume. The token is
  carried and the watcher restarts with it.

- **The no-shell guard read a fraction of the Taskfile.** It scanned `cmd:`
  mappings, the form the Taskfile uses least, and skipped scalar commands and
  `- |` blocks: a curl conditional with redirection, nine `cd x && y`
  scalars and a `| tail` pipeline sat beside it, and the changelog said the
  class was guarded. The guard reads every command form now, with a floor on
  how many it must find; the conditional is a Go tool (`tools/embedprobe`),
  the `cd` is a task with its own `dir:`, and the pipeline was redundant with
  what the coverage gate prints.

- **An upgrade whose stop timed out could leave the board down while
  reporting a restart.** Recovery started the replacement and went home. A
  replacement started while the old daemon still held the directory lock
  exited on it at once, the start reported success because nothing watched
  the process past its launch, and nothing tried again once the old one had
  gone. Recovery now waits for the board to answer and starts the daemon
  again while the old process drains, up to three times, and says which of
  those happened; a start whose process exits at once is reported as the
  failure it is.

- **The board's own certificate is renewed while the daemon runs.** The
  README promised that the daemon replaces its short-lived certificate as it
  nears expiry, and the daemon issued one at startup and installed it for
  good: an uninterrupted year, and every client's next connection would have
  failed on an expired leaf they had been told would be replaced. The leaf is
  now served through a handshake-time check that re-issues it under the
  board CA inside the renewal window, rate-limited to one attempt an hour. An
  operator's own certificate is served as it is. A certificate that stops
  naming the address clients dial is still replaced at the next start, and
  the README now says so.

- **The README promised a rollback the upgrade cannot perform.** It said a
  failure between the stop and the start restarts the build that was
  running; recovery restarts the build just installed, and the previous
  binary is not retained. The README says what happens.

- **The Codex plugin note denied the wake route this release ships.** It
  said nothing outside the harness can wake an idle thread and that Dibs
  would not reach into Codex's durable queue, while the configuration guide
  documents `codex queue` as the daemon's fallback for a thread the desktop
  app holds open. The note names the route and where the recipe is.

- **`release_session` and `bind_session` left the wake on the old
  session.** Recording the current session in round eight added a field the
  release did not clear and the explicit bind did not set: after
  `update(release_session: true)` reported the release, mail still woke the
  session the caller had given up, and after `bind_session(B)` reported B the
  wake resumed A. Both follow the current session now.

- **A default registration was told it could not be recovered while being
  handed the nonce that recovers it.** The recovery advice tested the nonce
  the caller sent, and a persistent agent that sent none had just been given
  one in the same reply: the reply said "no recovery credential, re-register
  with a fresh nonce", and following that makes the sibling mailbox this
  release exists to prevent. The advice reads the nonce the agent actually
  has.

- **A restart lost every deferred wake.** A wake held back for a recipient's
  recency window or cooldown was a timer, and the daemon restarting before it
  fired forgot it: the question stayed in the ledger, boot rebuilt the
  blocking notices and primed the socket cache, the sweeps retried no
  delivery, and the recipient slept until something else arrived for it or a
  person noticed. Boot now arms one retry for every agent holding blocking
  mail, and the retry makes the decision a fresh arrival would.

- **Returning to an earlier thread woke the wrong one.** The wake resumed the
  last thread id in the agent's alias list, and a return to a thread bound
  earlier changed nothing in that list: an identity on thread A, then B, then
  A again was woken on B, a real session that was not the one holding the
  mail, and the wake logged as a success. The harness's most recently
  reported session is recorded as the current one now (`current_session` on
  the board), the wake and the socket route prefer it, and a resume that
  returns to a known thread counts as the change it is.

- **A session that appeared after the socket cache was scanned missed its
  wake for good.** The socket route decides from a cache the writer loop never
  refreshes, and a refusal from it was final: blocking mail sent to a Claude
  session that started after the last scan got its one wake attempt against a
  snapshot that did not have it, and the thirty-second refresh revisits no
  mail. A refusal that could be the cache's staleness arms one retry, and a
  deferred retry refreshes the cache, off the loop, before it decides.

- **`register` now returns the fingerprint every role-pinning instruction
  said it did.** The README, the configuration guide and the daemon's own
  refusal all directed the operator to paste the fingerprint `register`
  returns under `[roles.identity]`, and `register` returned no such thing: the
  value existed for the startup log and internal callers only. It is in the
  registration result as `fingerprint`.

- **The tracked-file hygiene walk treated every stat error as a deleted
  file.** A tracked file beneath a directory that cannot be entered, or a
  symlink to nothing, never reached the read that fails for an unreadable
  file, and with enough other files visited the guard passed having examined
  neither. Only a path that is not there at all is skipped now.

- **`[limits] max_agents = 32` alone stopped the daemon starting.** The
  persistent default rose to 64 this cycle, and the startup check compared it
  against an explicit total after applying it: an operator who had set
  nothing about persistence was told their persistent setting exceeded the
  total, on a configuration every release to v0.0.6 accepted. The shared
  loader compared the raw setting and accepted it, so `dibs mcp-config`
  printed a configuration the daemon would not boot on. An unset persistent
  ceiling now follows the total down; a stated one above it is still refused.
  The configuration guide, which still listed the old default of sixteen and
  reasoned from it, says what ships.

- **The bridge dropped a second inbox notice inside its cooldown.** Two
  arrivals within fifteen seconds read as one interruption, which is right,
  and the second was returned as success and forgotten, which is not: an
  agent that had read its inbox after the first notice and finished never
  heard about the second message until something else arrived for it. A
  failed delivery also spent the cooldown, so a busy socket at the first
  arrival silenced the session for fifteen seconds. One deferred notice is
  armed for when the cooldown ends and every further arrival folds into it,
  and only a delivered notice starts the cooldown.

- **Sending to the human warned that nothing could wake "dibs web".** The
  pull-only note written for agents was attached to every `send`, the human's
  mailbox included, and told the sender delivery waited on `inbox` or
  `check_in` while the desktop notification the send path raises was already
  on its way. That misled the one decision the note exists to inform, whether
  to wait for a person's approval. The human's mailbox carries no wake note.

- **Two checkpoint repairs rewrote history on replay.** The round-three fixes
  that stamp `LastCoordination` on `claim_coordinator` and `prune` did so for
  every op in the fold, historical ones included. A v0.0.6 agent that claimed
  with a stale checkpoint and then re-registered with its nonce got a fresh
  token and a serial; replayed under the new stamp, the claim had refreshed
  the checkpoint, the register took the "still active" shortcut, kept the old
  token and allocated nothing, and every serial after it disagreed with the
  ledger. Both are now gated on the op's recorded semantics, as every other
  v0.0.7 repair to the fold is.

- **A v0.0.6 retention sweep hid, on replay, a question it never hid.** Under
  v0.0.6 the mailbox watermark was inert, a number in a result, and a sweep
  raised it past whatever terminal mail it evicted, pending questions below
  that included. The readers that honour the watermark arrived this cycle,
  and the round-three clamp that keeps it from passing mail still present was
  gated to v0.0.7 sweeps so a v0.0.6 sweep would "replay to the watermark it
  set". It replayed to a watermark that now hid a question, and `check_in`
  stopped delivering it. The clamp applies to every sweep; only the fence
  (which v0.0.6 registration never set) is v0.0.7's to protect.

- **Reading adopted mail left it pending.** `inbox` handed over the body of an
  adopted message below the heir's watermark and never marked it delivered,
  because the delivery pass applied the watermark without the exemption the
  listing had. The sender saw no receipt for mail that had been read. Both
  apply the same exemption now.

- **`resume` never started the bridge's wake subscription, and rotated the
  token under it.** The bridge watches its own inbox with the token a
  `register` reply carries. `resume` also mints one, and the hook ignored it:
  a session that began with `resume` was never watched, and one that resumed
  later kept subscribing with the credential the resume had just revoked. The
  hook handles both.

- **The bridge woke its session for a `notify`.** Every inbox change put a
  "check the board" notice into the running session, a notify included, while
  the daemon's own waker (for `[wake.exec]` and the session socket) has always
  refused to start anything for news nobody is blocked on. The inbox
  notification now names the event that changed it (`com.dibs/event`,
  `com.dibs/msg_type` in its `_meta`), and the bridge applies the daemon's
  rule, `core.WakeWorthy`, which is now the one place that rule lives. A
  notification from a daemon too old to say what arrived still wakes.

- **The archive gate accepted a script under a binary's name.** Every path it
  requires is one the runtime executes, and a required entry that was not a
  Mach-O image was skipped as "documentation": an empty file, a shell script
  or an ELF binary under `dibd` passed, and so did a correct binary carried
  without its execute bit, because entry modes were discarded. Each required
  path must now be a Mach-O for the archive's architecture with the execute
  bit set.

- **`doctor` reported a healthy wake configuration on a board where 28 of 31
  agents could not be woken.** It counted the operator's `[wake.exec]` blocks and
  called that coverage. One command was configured, it covered one harness, and
  twelve Claude Code agents had no route at all: the check said
  "1 wake command(s) configured" and moved on. Counting what you configured is
  not measuring what it covers, which is the same error as a wake that reports
  success and reaches nobody.

  It now compares the configured harnesses against the persistent agents
  actually on the board, names the harnesses with no route and how many agents
  each leaves stranded, and prints the exact `dibs.toml` block to paste for the
  harnesses whose resume command has been measured. Dibs still runs nothing the
  operator did not configure (rule 5); what was missing was never consent, it
  was knowing what to write.

  Rows that are not threads are excluded: the human, the daemon's own agent and
  the web board are not things a command can resume, and reporting them as
  unreachable is the kind of false alarm that teaches people to skim a health
  check.

- **The reattach hint was repeated before every prompt, forever.** An
  unregistered session in a directory holding idle agents was told it could
  reattach on SessionStart, and then again on every UserPromptSubmit, Stop and
  SubagentStop for the life of the session. The function that composes it
  carried the reason in its own comment, "a hook that speaks on every turn is
  one people disable", and then did exactly that, because it was a pure
  function of session and directory with no memory of having spoken.

  Reported by an operator whose agent had already worked out the trap and said
  so: it could not turn this off. Unregistering makes it fire MORE, since "not
  registered" is the trigger condition, and the only switch is the plugin's
  global one, which would take Dibs away from every other session on the
  machine. A hint you cannot decline, repeated on every turn, is coercive
  whatever it says, and rule 4 is that this service is advisory.

  Said once per session now, and the hint says so. It is a pointer, and a
  pointer that did not land the first time does not land the tenth; an agent
  that read it and chose not to reattach has decided. The same class of bug was
  fixed once already for the install nudge, which is the argument for the test
  that now watches this one.

- **The hint did not agree with itself in number**, so three agents "is idle
  now". Prose a person reads over their agent's shoulder, and the tell that
  nobody had looked at the output.

- **`dibs upgrade` could take the board down and report that it had not.**
  `stop` sends SIGTERM and waits ten seconds for the process to go. On timeout
  it returned an error saying the daemon "is still holding" the data directory,
  and `upgrade` turned that into "could not stop the daemon, so nothing else was
  changed". Both are false in the way that matters: a SIGTERM HAS been
  delivered. The daemon exited a few seconds later, launchd left it down because
  a clean exit is not a crash, and a 32-agent board disappeared while its
  operator was reading that nothing had happened. Measured here, by doing it.

  Three changes. The wait is 60s, because a daemon closing a ledger it has just
  replayed can reasonably take longer than ten and waiting costs nothing. The
  error says the signal landed and that the daemon should be treated as
  STOPPING, names what will not restart it and why, and gives the command that
  will. And `upgrade` now marks the daemon stopped on that path too, which arms
  the recovery it already had: the file's own comment says "a daemon this
  command stopped is a daemon it is responsible for starting... leaving a fleet
  with no board and an error message is the worst outcome available here", and
  the one path that produced exactly that outcome was the one that skipped it. (That alone was not enough: the recovery
  was registered below the stop, so the flag was set on a path that returned
  before the `defer` existed. See the review findings below.)

- **Every agent paid ~18,000 tokens per activation to be told who else was on
  the board.** `Board()` is what both `register` and `check_in` return, and
  `dibs://skills` tells every agent to check in at the start of every
  activation. Measured on a live 32-agent board: 77,770 chars, of which `slots`
  were 51,803 and one field, `predicted`, was 38,070.

  `Slot.Predicted` is the work-overlap scorer's own intermediate, a per-path
  weight vector the daemon derives to decide whether two agents are near each
  other's work. Matching reads it from state. No view has ever read it from a
  board: not the human panel, not `board.js`, not `dibs board`, not the e2e
  suites. It is gone from the copy handed out, and the state keeps it, which the
  test asserts alongside the coordination content that must survive.

  Roughly half the payload, on the busiest call in the protocol. For scale, this
  project guards `tools/list` with a hard test at 8,700 tokens and was shipping
  twice that per activation with nothing measuring it at all.

- **The bridge refused a config key it did not know, and said the daemon would
  too.** `dibs mcp-stdio` reads `dibs.toml` to find the daemon, and refused the
  whole file on any key its own build could not place, printing "the daemon
  will not start on it either". The bridge is the binary a session started
  with, so between every `task install` and that session's restart it is older
  than the daemon; it blocked a live delivery on this machine over a `fallback`
  key the daemon had accepted and was serving on. A program that is not the
  file's authority does not get to speak for the one that is.

  `Load` now reports unknown keys as a typed error alongside the decoded
  config. The daemon still refuses them, loudly, naming the key. The bridge
  proceeds on them and still refuses a file that does not parse, with its
  reasons intact, because there the address really is a guess.

- **Round three of the review: five more, one of them a leak round two
  introduced.** The retention clamp lowered the watermark to any remaining
  message addressed to a reused id, predecessor mail included, undoing the fence
  registration sets to hide a previous occupant's mailbox; it may now undo only
  the raise the same sweep made. Adoption skipped mail that an earlier adoption
  had brought into the source, so a second adoption passed the emptiness check
  and moved nothing; it honours the mark as the inbox does. The bridge's
  self-wake subscription was started once per process with the first token
  baked in, so a reattach's rotated token left it failing authentication
  forever after the next reconnect, silently; a new token retires the old
  stream. A resume that binds a new alias is ledgered but never touched the
  durable checkpoint, so a restart just past the old TTL booted the agent stale;
  it does now. And `send`'s note said nothing could wake an agent the daemon
  was about to nudge over its session socket; it now says a best-effort notice
  will be tried and that nothing can confirm it.

- **Round two of the review: six more, all confirmed, three of them consequences
  of round one.** The retention clamp was gated on the sweep's recorded
  semantics and the daemon builds its own sweep ops without passing the path
  that stamps them, so no production sweep ever ran it; its test called `gc`
  directly and proved nothing about the wiring. Both construction sites stamp
  the flag now and the test drives the real sweep. The `read_mail` exemption for
  adopted mail applied to anyone named on the message, which let a replacement
  registered under the old sender's name read the old body and answer by
  serial; it is the heir's alone. The adoption filter on the source watermark,
  itself a v0.0.7 security fix, had no replay gate, so a v0.0.6 adoption would
  replay moving less than it moved and the heir's recorded answer would refuse;
  gated. Adopted mail below a reused heir's own watermark was reported moved
  and hidden; the floor exempts what adoption marked. `bind_session` recorded
  whom it took a session from and never dropped it there. And a returning agent
  that stated an alias the daemon had guessed left it marked guessed, still
  reclaimable by anyone; stating it now confirms it.

  One of those fixes introduced a crash on the way through, caught by the space
  e2e before it was committed: the adoption exemption dereferenced the message
  before the check that guards it, so `read_mail` on a serial that did not
  exist segfaulted the daemon. Guarded, with a regression that reads a missing
  serial, which no unit test had ever done.

- **Six findings from the different-model pre-release review, all confirmed
  and fixed.** Widening the session reattach to aliases and dormant rows had
  been done in the fold without a replay gate, so a v0.0.6 ledger whose op
  created a sibling would replay to the original instead and then refuse the
  sibling's next op; it is gated on the recorded semantics now, with the
  historical rule kept for historical ops. Retention raised the mailbox
  watermark past a pending question older than the evicted answers, hiding mail
  it never removed; the watermark is clamped to the oldest message still
  addressed to the agent (and, as round two found, only wired into the daemon's own sweeps a round later). The upgrade's recovery `defer` was registered after
  the stop it covers, so a stop that timed out returned before it existed and
  the promised restart never ran; the earlier guard compared string order in
  the source and passed, and is replaced by one that runs the cutover with a
  failing stop. Taking a thread from a dormant holder added it to the new agent
  and never removed it from the old, leaving hooks to resolve by map order; the
  takeover is recorded on every binding op and the lookup prefers the live
  holder. The ingress guard kept its own copy of the fold's reattach rule and
  fell behind it, refusing a default-registered agent that had lost its context
  as a thief; it asks the fold now. And an heir could not read the mail it had
  just adopted, because everything older than its own creation read as
  inherited; adoption marks what it moves.

- **`review:release` says which reviewer it found, before spending a token.**
  Two codex binaries live on this machine and the older one, first on PATH,
  cannot run the configured model; the failure read as a model error. The path
  and version are printed, and `DIBS_REVIEWER` names one explicitly.

- **A codex thread open in the desktop app can be woken.** This is the case
  that was reported as unreachable for weeks. `codex exec resume`, the only
  command anyone had configured, refuses a thread the desktop app has open:
  "thread-store conflict: already has an active writer", exit 1, and no
  environment or directory changes that, which is why two earlier diagnoses of
  the failure were wrong. The command that reaches an open thread is
  `codex queue --thread <id> --message <text>`: the app's own app-server drains
  the queue and injects it as a user message. It is the exact inverse of
  `exec resume`, which starts a CLOSED thread that `queue` would park a message
  on forever, exit 0, with nothing reading it.

  So `[wake.exec.<harness>]` gains `fallback`, a second argv run only when the
  first exits non-zero, under every rule the first obeys and through the same
  validator. The log records which command delivered. `dibs doctor` suggests
  both for codex.

  Measured end to end on this machine. A thread open in the desktop app refused
  the primary, took the fallback, and its own transcript then showed "Dibs:
  check the board." followed by the agent reattaching, checking in, and
  answering two questions it had been sent: `AWAKE, 2026-09-05 16:57:14 PDT`.

- **Mail arriving while an agent was "recently in touch" was thrown away.**
  `maybeWake` short-circuits when the recipient called Dibs inside the wake
  cooldown, reasoning that it "is genuinely working and will see this at its own
  turn boundary". That holds only where a turn boundary REACHES Dibs. An agent
  whose harness sends no lifecycle hooks has none, so nothing ever marks its turn
  ended, recency decays into silence, and because `maybeWake` fires once per
  event with nothing retrying, the message's only delivery attempt was spent on
  the assumption.

  Measured, when the operator asked for a specific agent to be contacted: a
  question sent to an active codex agent 40 seconds after its last call, inside
  the 90-second window. No wake then, none after, and the daemon's log showed
  that harness had never delivered a single lifecycle hook, because it runs under
  the desktop app, which does not read the CLI's hooks file. Every Codex desktop
  agent on that board was in the same position.

  The window is a deferral now rather than a verdict, and the re-check re-arms
  while the mail is still blocking somebody: deferring once only moves the loss
  one window later, since an agent that calls again consumes the retry.
  `hasBlockingMail` ends the loop when the message is read, answered or expires.

- **`send` promised a wake that could not happen.** A message to a sleeping
  recipient returned "it will see this when it next wakes". True when something
  can wake it, and a lie otherwise, in the one sentence the sender acts on.
  Measured: a question to an idle codex agent holding no thread id. Accepted,
  that promise returned, no wake attempted anywhere in the daemon log, unread an
  hour later.

  The identical shape the fold already fixed one branch over, for a message to
  an agent superseded by a live sibling, where the comment records that Dibs
  "told the senders it would be seen when it next wakes. Nobody was coming."
  This is that failure reached from the other direction: not a retired identity,
  but a live one with no route to it.

  The fold cannot decide this and must not try, because whether a wake is
  possible depends on the operator's `[wake.exec]` configuration, which is
  impure and not replayable. So the engine's note now wins wherever it has one.
  There is still exactly one sentence, and it is the half that knows. The test
  that pinned the old behaviour asserted the right concern, two warnings about
  one delivery, through the wrong mechanism, and now asserts the property
  directly.

- **Which row a session id recovered was a coin flip.** The reattach loop ranged
  over the agent map and took the first match, and Go randomises map iteration.
  Two rows can match one reattach: a name that comes back is suffixed in the ID
  and keeps the NAME, so `bridgekind` and `bridgekind-3` are both named
  "bridgekind", and both can hold one thread, the first as an alias and the
  second as the id it registered under.

  A coin flip inside the fold breaks `state == fold(ledger)`: one ledger replays
  to different boards on different runs, and nothing reports it because each run
  is internally consistent. Observed on this board within a minute of widening
  the match to aliases and dormant rows, which is what turned a collision from
  exotic into ordinary.

  Selection is now ordered: a primary session id beats an alias, then the
  liveliest status, then the lowest id for stability. Its test runs the same
  case fifty times per pass, because map order is randomised per iteration and a
  single run is exactly the shape of check that passes against the bug it was
  written for. Against the unordered version it splits 45/5.

- **An agent could not be recovered by the only id its harness gives it.**
  Reattach matched an agent's PRIMARY session id. An agent answers to several:
  the bridge derives one, and a harness that names its own thread contributes
  another as an alias. Codex sends `threadId` in `_meta` on every call, so for a
  codex agent the identifier that identifies it is almost always the alias, and
  it was the one that would not work: re-registering forked a sibling that could
  not read its predecessor's mail.

  The status test was wrong in the same way. It admitted `active` and `stale`,
  where `stale` is the EPHEMERAL lapse and `dormant`, its persistent equivalent,
  was simply absent. Harmless while persistent agents were rare and held nonces
  their operators chose; not harmless once persistent became the default, since
  the common case is now an agent that parked, holds a nonce it was given rather
  than chose, and can present nothing but its thread. The credential rule is
  unchanged: an agent that brought its own nonce is still not reachable by an id
  somebody could guess.

  Found while trying to retire a leftover test row by the only id it had, which
  created two more.

- **A dormant agent held a live thread hostage, and both ends of the wake path
  broke.** `mayClaimSession` refused to bind a session id already held by
  another agent, on the grounds that moving it would redirect that agent's wake
  delivery. Right for a live holder, and wrong for one that has stopped
  answering: a dormant agent's session ended with its process, so it cannot be
  occupying the thread it still owns.

  While it did, both directions failed at once and each looked like success. A
  wake for the dormant row started the thread and reached whoever was running in
  it now, who checked their own mailbox, found it empty and truthfully reported
  no mail; and the agent that actually WAS that session, refused its own id,
  held no thread at all and could never be woken by anything. Measured with
  `codex-root-2` dormant for three weeks and a live agent in the thread it
  owned.

  THE SAME RULE AS `refuseStealingAnotherThreadsSession`, which learned it first
  and alone. Two implementations of one rule is this repository's most expensive
  recurring bug and it happened again, four hundred lines away, reached by a
  different call. Both are now exercised by one fixture in one test, so the next
  person to change either finds the other.

- **An agent that stated no kind got one that could not park, be woken, or hold
  mail.** `ephemeral` was the default. It means swept to `stale` rather than
  `dormant` when the session ends, no durable mailbox, and no nonce, which is
  the only credential that recovers an identity. So the default opted an agent
  out of every guarantee this product exists to make, silently, at the one call
  where nobody is thinking about it. An agent that took it could not go idle and
  come back, which is the whole point of a coordination board.

  The evidence was self-erasing, which is why it lasted. Counting the kinds of
  the agents still ON a board says almost nobody uses ephemeral, because
  ephemeral agents are exactly the ones no longer there; that reasoning was
  offered here, in this changelog's own draft, and it was survivorship bias.
  What actually surfaced it was a test agent that registered twice in one
  afternoon and had evaporated both times, and then a wake that resolved to the
  thread it had been running in, reached an identity with an empty mailbox, and
  truthfully reported "no mail".

  An unstated kind is now `persistent`, decided at INGRESS and written into the
  op, never in the fold: `Apply` still defaults to ephemeral and must forever,
  or every registration already on disk that stated no kind replays as something
  it never was. That has its own test, which asserts the old behaviour on
  purpose so a future tidy-up cannot "fix" the inconsistency by making the two
  agree. `ephemeral` remains available to anything that asks for it by name.

  A persistent agent needs a nonce, so one is minted for a caller that brings
  none and handed back with instructions to keep it: a durable mailbox whose
  credential nobody holds is the orphan `adopt_agent` exists to clean up after.
  The minted value travels in its own op field rather than in `nonce`, because
  that field is a CLAIM: a non-empty one selects the nonce reattach path and
  disqualifies the `session_id` one, so the first version of this broke
  context-loss recovery for every agent and forked siblings instead. Three unit
  tests passed against that; the space e2e caught it in one run, by asking
  whether the old agent could still come back.

  `max_persistent_agents` moves from 16 to 64, matching `MaxAgents`. Sixteen was
  sized for a board where persistent meant "standing role"; it now counts every
  agent registered inside `dormancy_max`, which is thirty days.

- **A resuming agent's thread id was dropped, so it could not be woken
  afterwards.** The `resumed` branch of `register` was written as a
  response-loss retry: the same nonce twice inside one TTL means the client
  never saw the first answer, so return it again and change nothing. Right for
  a retry, and not the only traffic that lands there. An active agent
  re-registering at the start of an activation, which is what `dibs://skills`
  instructs, also comes back `resumed`, and it may be doing so from a session
  the board has never seen. Codex sends `threadId` in `_meta` on every call and
  that id is exactly what `codex exec resume` takes, so this was the moment a
  returning agent handed over the one thing that makes it reachable, and it went
  in the bin. The agent stayed wakeable only for as long as it kept making other
  calls: register, then stop, and nothing could start it again.

  Measured before the fix: 15 of 29 persistent agents on this board had a wake
  command for their harness and no thread for it to name, one of which had
  registered that morning.

  Gated on `V7Semantics` and on the alias being NEW. Binding is replayable state
  so it has to advance the serial and be ledgered, and doing that ungated would
  make replay of a v0.0.6 ledger advance the serial where the original fold did
  not, leaving every serial after it disagreeing with what the ledger records.
  A genuine retry still writes nothing, which has its own test.

- **The wake ran in the daemon's working directory, so it never reached anybody.**
  `wakePlan` has carried a `cwd` field since the path shipped, set from the
  agent's own record and commented as "where the agent says it works". Nothing
  ever read it. The command therefore inherited the DAEMON'S directory, which
  under launchd is `/`, and `codex exec resume` refuses to start there: "Not
  inside a trusted directory". Exit 1, which is exactly the failure this
  repository's own daemon log recorded three times.

  A field that is declared, populated, documented and never read is worse than a
  missing one, because the mechanism looks finished. That is this project's most
  expensive recurring bug class and it was sitting in the middle of the feature
  whose entire purpose is reaching an agent nobody else can.

  It was in fact two bugs stacked, and the first fix only found one. `wakeFor`
  has two returns: the socket route, which needs no directory and had carried
  one since the field existed, and the command route, which runs the process and
  carried none. So the field WAS assigned, on the branch that cannot use it,
  which is exactly why it read as used. Setting `cmd.Dir` alone changed nothing
  in production, and the test that covered it passed anyway because it called
  the executor directly and never the decision that feeds it. Both layers are
  tested now, and both tests were watched failing.

  Verified end to end on both harnesses, against real stopped threads rather
  than fixtures: `claude --resume` and `codex exec resume` each resumed their
  own thread and delivered the one fixed sentence, with the daemon logging
  "woke an agent that was not running" for each.

  **The previous entry here blamed launchd's security session and the login
  keychain, and that was wrong.** It is left described rather than deleted
  because the wrong explanation cost two investigations and shaped a paragraph
  of `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`: a probe LaunchAgent in the identical domain and
  `ProcessType` as `dibd` read the login keychain and ran a complete
  `claude --resume` turn, exit 0. A confident diagnosis that names the wrong
  cause is more expensive than no diagnosis, because it stops anyone looking.

  A failing wake now names the directory it really ran in. Its output stays
  withheld, because a wake command runs a whole agent turn and that output is
  somebody's decrypted mail; the argv is printed instead.

- **Codex hands a child MCP server nothing**, which is why the local wake above
  is Claude Code only. Measured by having a probe MCP server dump its own
  environment under Codex: no session id, no socket, no token. Codex sends its
  thread id in `_meta` on every call, so an agent binds correctly and mail
  arrives at its turn boundaries through the shipped hooks; reaching one that
  has STOPPED still needs `[wake.exec]`, and that is now the documented
  difference rather than an omission.

- **The socket wake could not deliver to the sessions a fleet actually runs in,
  and every document said it worked out of the box.** Measured, not reasoned:
  a notice was delivered to an IDLE live Claude Code session, the write
  succeeded, and that session's transcript never grew. The reason is in the
  receiving client. Inbound peer messages pass a `crossSessionInbound` policy,
  and with no explicit setting a receiver in **bypassPermissions** mode HOLDS
  any peer message whose sender asserts no mode of its own; the branch that
  would read an asserted mode sits behind a feature flag that is off by
  default. So no message a sender can construct is delivered to a session in
  bypass, which is what an unattended fleet runs in.

  There is also no receipt. The protocol carries a `peer_message_status` frame
  (held / denied / expired / delivered) addressed back to a `uds:` reply socket,
  and a daemon has none to give, so Dibs writes the bytes and learns nothing.

  Nothing about the code was wrong; the claims around it were. `WAKE-MECHANISMS.md`
  §5b said a message had been "watched arrive", which had been measured against a
  socket rather than a session. The README and AGENTS.md rule 5 presented the two
  routes as equals. They are not: `[wake.exec]` spawns a process and the daemon
  sees its exit status, and the socket is best effort. All three now say so, the
  wake e2e's check names say "reaches the socket" rather than "reaches it"
  (its receiver is the test, which accepts anything a real client would gate),
  and `SKILLS.md` tells agents not to rely on being woken.

  `dibs doctor` reports wake coverage now, because the difference was invisible:
  a board with no `[wake.exec]` is told, in those words, that its only route
  cannot be confirmed.

- **`dibs doctor` called a correctly configured harness broken.** It matched any
  64-hex run anywhere in a config file, so the SHA-256 in an unrelated MCP
  server's `NODE_REPL_TRUSTED_BROWSER_CLIENT_SHA256S` was read as a stale Dibs
  secret and reported as "codex config has a STALE secret: that harness sees
  ZERO Dibs tools". The codex install it said that about was on the stdio bridge
  and working, and the advice, to re-copy the block from `dibs mcp-config`,
  would have replaced it with an HTTP one. A harness config holds every server
  that harness has, and other people's servers carry their own credentials; a
  Dibs secret is only ever the value of `X-Dibs-Local` or a bearer token, and
  that is what is matched now. Found in live use.

- **A dormant agent held a live session's id forever, and that is what stopped
  Dibs working.** A session id names a harness thread, and a thread has one
  occupant. Register refused any id another agent held unless that agent was
  closed or archived, so a DORMANT row blocked the session behind it
  permanently: the rightful caller was told "already held by <agent>" and
  pointed at register-with-your-nonce, which is a call only the other agent can
  make. The documented remedy, `update(release_session: true)`, needs that
  agent's own token. There was no remedy the refused party could take.

  Measured on this project's own board, which is where this was found: 29
  lifecycle hooks arriving from working sessions, **not one** resolving to an
  agent, the claim guard allowing every edit and no mail ever injected, because
  the session that could have registered was refused its own id by a row that
  had been dormant for days. The daemon said so plainly the whole time
  (`dibs doctor`, `/api/hook-health`: "not one call has resolved to a registered
  agent"), and nobody had looked.

  A holder that has stopped answering now loses the id to the session
  presenting it, and the losing row is recorded on the op so replay strips the
  same one rather than re-deciding what dormant means today. **Nothing about
  mail moves**: the old row keeps its mailbox, its history, its claims and its
  recovery credential, and only where a WAKE is delivered changes. An ACTIVE
  holder still wins, because two live agents claiming one thread is a real
  conflict rather than stale state, and taking it would redirect a working
  agent's wakes. The refusal that remains names calls the refused party can
  actually make.

- **`release_session` reported and recorded a release of nothing.** It cleared
  the primary id, the aliases and the provenance and then said
  `session_released: true` whatever it had found, so calling it against an agent
  with nothing bound advanced the serial, appended an op that changed no
  replayable state, and told the caller a binding had been taken away. "An op is
  ledgered iff it changed replayable state" is the rule this repository states
  about itself. Its test only ever exercised a populated binding.

  The agent-facing schema also understated what it destroys: it said "the
  harness session id" and reported only the primary, so an agent reached through
  an alias was told it released nothing while the alias it was actually reached
  by had just been taken away. Both found by the pre-release review.

- **`claim_coordinator` and `prune_own` skipped the durable coordination
  checkpoint.** Both return straight out of the dispatcher, before the line
  under the comment saying every ledgered actor op refreshes it. The daemon's
  derived `seen` map hides that while it runs and is deliberately not
  replayable, so after a restart an agent is judged against the checkpoint it
  held BEFORE the op: one that had just claimed coordinator could be swept stale
  immediately. Adoption already carried the identical repair, which is what made
  it findable. Found by the pre-release review.

- **Pruning an already-closed record said it pruned it.** The repair that
  stopped the no-op reaching the ledger stopped there: nothing was emitted and
  the serial did not move, and the answer was still `{"ok":true,"pruned":<id>}`.
  The sibling admin path truthfully returns an empty list and `count: 0`. Its
  regression test discarded the result, so the false success was never in view.
  Found by the pre-release review.

- **`dibs upgrade` verified a different daemon than the one it restarted.** The
  plan discovers the target's real address from the registry each live daemon
  writes, and it does that on purpose: assuming the address is how a board
  serving on a LAN address gets restarted on loopback, taking every remote agent
  off it while every local check still passes. Having found the address, both
  the before-snapshot and the verification then called the address-free helper,
  which resolves through the CLI's own environment and config, so the proof that
  the board came back was collected from whichever daemon THAT named.

  Reproduced with two boards: upgrade stopped one, read the other, printed
  `upgraded: serial 0, 0 agent(s)` and returned success while its target was
  serving nothing. With a single board on an address the CLI does not know, the
  restart works and a failure is reported that did not happen. An earlier
  release fixed *whether* upgrade stops the right daemon; this is the half that
  decides which one it then looks at, and the shipped help has been claiming it
  "verifies the fleet came back" throughout. Found by the pre-release review,
  with a reproduction.

  The first version of that fix then borrowed the CONFIGURED board's transport
  for the discovered address, because the resolver answers for the address the
  config names: a TLS target beside a plaintext config was contacted over HTTP,
  and a loopback target beside a TLS config over HTTPS, both failing inside the
  transport and reading as "the board did not come back". The restart half of
  this command already carried that argument and a `sameHostPort` guard; the
  reading half now does too. Caught by the next review round, whose regression
  test the first one could not have failed: it used two plain-HTTP servers.

- **A role was checked for spelling inside the replay fold.** `applyGrantRole`
  rejected an unknown role in `Apply`, which is the fold that replays ops
  accepted by older code, so removing or renaming a role would make the new
  build refuse a `grant_role` already in its own ledger and stop the daemon
  booting. The typed request path immediately beside it does this in `Admit` and
  carries the paragraph explaining why. The test meant to guard the rule asked
  `State.Apply` to reject `"superuser"`, so it froze the wrong placement: the
  test written to protect the rule was pinning the bug that broke it. It asserts
  both halves now, and `grant_role` is enumerated in the guard that walks this
  class. Fifth time this mistake has been caught here. Found by the pre-release
  review.

- **Adoption reported records the heir could not read as rescued mail.**
  `Inbox` excludes a finished message once its addressee has collected it. The
  handover moved and counted every record above the watermark, consumed ones
  included, beside a note that says "read them with inbox", so a mailbox holding
  one unread message and one already acknowledged reported two and showed one,
  to a coordinator deciding whether the rescue was worth authorising. One
  definition of "would this appear in an inbox" now serves both. Found by the
  pre-release review.

- **Mail the recipient could not see filled its mailbox and was reported
  delivered.** Two more readings of the ownership watermark that asked only
  whether a message was addressed to an id, found by sweeping for the class the
  previous round turned up.

  The capacity metric counted a previous occupant's mail, so a send could be
  refused with `E_MAILBOX_FULL` against an agent whose inbox reads as empty, and
  nothing could clear it: the recipient cannot see the mail, so it cannot read,
  answer, ack or consume it, and the sender is simply refused. Only a notify may
  displace, so a question to that agent was refused permanently. Rule 6 says an
  error names the corrective call; this one had none to name.

  The delivery marker had the same gap, and that one is a claim made to the
  SENDER. Mail below the watermark is not in the inbox the agent just read, so
  marking it delivered told its sender it had reached somebody who had not seen
  it and never would. Worse than a message that fails to arrive, because an
  undelivered message still reads as undelivered and this removes the one signal
  that would have prompted them to ask.

- **The operator's space transcript rendered every announcement with no text.**
  The board payload carried announcement bodies until it turned out `Board()` is
  what `check_in` returns to every agent on every activation, so every
  announcement in every space was going to agents that had joined none of them.
  Stripping it there was right. What it left was a transcript rendering the
  sender and the acknowledgement state above an empty span, under a comment
  promising "bodies, not a count, because the whole reason a human joins a space
  is to see what the agents are saying", and another asserting that nothing read
  the field, which the board renderer had been doing all along. The test guarding
  the confidentiality half passed throughout, because it asserts the metadata
  survives and nothing asserted the operator could still read anything.

  The text comes from `/api/messages` now, joined to the transcript by serial:
  the route that already solves this for decrypted mail, behind the page key,
  which is port-scoped and so is not handed to every local service the operator
  visits. The coordination secret does not open it, which is now asserted rather
  than assumed, because a route that started carrying more had better be the
  narrow one. Found by the pre-release review.

- **Restarting the daemon disconnected every agent on the machine, for the rest
  of its session.** The bridge returned on a request it could not deliver, which
  ends the process, and no harness restarts a stdio MCP server. The agent saw
  one "server disconnected" line: not which server, not that its board was gone,
  not that the mail it was waiting on would never arrive. It kept working with
  no coordination at all. The ten-second grace covers an upgrade, which is
  drain-swap-start and takes milliseconds; it was never going to cover an
  operator rebuilding the daemon they are working on, and that is what a person
  actually does. Measured here after one restart: six live sessions, zero bridge
  processes.

  The bridge now answers the call and keeps serving. The reply says whether the
  request could have been applied, because a refused dial proves it was not read
  and any other failure leaves the question open, and the next call dials again,
  so a session reattaches by itself the moment the daemon is back.

- **The bridge's ordinary shutdown ran the emergency exit.**
  `signal.NotifyContext`'s stop function cancels the context it returned, and a
  deferred stop runs before the deferred cancel above it, so every clean exit
  cancelled the signal context first. The watcher could not tell that from a
  real SIGTERM and called `os.Exit(0)`, skipping the bounded wait that is the
  only guarantee no stream goroutine outlives the process. Both paths ended at
  status 0, which is why nothing surfaced it. Found while writing the test for
  the entry above, which could not run at all: a test binary does not survive
  `os.Exit`.

- **A refused `subscriptions/listen` retried forever and told the harness
  nothing.** A listen answers with a stream, so the bridge stopped reading the
  response as a reply and pumped it for SSE frames. A refusal is not a stream:
  the daemon writes an ordinary JSON-RPC error when `dibs://inbox` arrives
  without a token, when the token is one it does not know, or when the writer
  cannot flush. `pumpSSE` drops every line lacking a `data: ` prefix, so the
  error was discarded whole, the instant end-of-body read as a daemon that had
  gone away, and the bridge re-POSTed the same doomed request every 150ms for
  the life of the session. The harness had asked to be told about mail and
  would have waited forever. A response that is not `text/event-stream` is now
  an answer: it goes back as the reply to the harness's own call, paired by id,
  and the loop stops. A body that is not JSON-RPC at all (a proxy's error page)
  becomes one, because stdout is a JSON-RPC channel, with a hint naming
  `await_events` as the corrective call.

- **Six end-to-end suites raced the daemon they had just started.** Each polled
  for `local.secret` and treated the file appearing as "the daemon is up". The
  daemon writes that secret most of a startup before it binds its listener, so
  the first request after the poll raced the bind and lost often enough to fail
  a CI run on a working daemon: `ConnectionRefused`, from a suite whose subject
  was fine. Several sites did not even check the secret was found, and would
  have gone on to send an empty one. They now wait for a socket that answers a
  request. A daemon that dies during startup reports its exit status instead of
  presenting as a timeout, because "dibd exited with status 1" is the finding
  and "waited ten seconds" sends the reader to look at timing.

- **A board's certificate could not both expire and stay trusted.** `dibs trust`
  pins what a daemon presents, ssh-style, so a single self-signed certificate
  made the pinned identity and the served certificate one object and the two
  requirements mutually exclusive: a bounded lifetime needs the certificate
  replaced, and replacing it makes every joined machine refuse the board until a
  human repeats the fingerprint ceremony there. Not replacing it means an
  always-on hub sails past `NotAfter` and serves an expired certificate to
  everybody. Both are silent on the daemon and total on the clients.

  The daemon now keeps a long-lived signing identity (`tls-ca.pem`) and serves a
  short-lived certificate under it. `dibs trust` records the identity, so
  renewal, a new interface, and a change of network are all invisible to
  machines that have already trusted the board. **Anyone who has run `dibs
  trust` against a v0.0.6 board re-runs it once**, and never again; that
  ceremony was already owed, because a v0.0.6 certificate does not carry the
  SANs a reachable address needs.

- **An interrupted certificate rotation could not be recovered from.** The pair
  is two files, and the reuse check asked only whether the key file existed. A
  crash between the writes therefore left a mismatch that every later boot
  declared usable: startup failed inside `ServeTLS` and exited, and the
  predicate responsible for regenerating kept saying there was nothing to
  regenerate. It loads the pair now, which is the same question `ServeTLS` asks.

- **An empty `[wake.exec]` entry reported a wake capability that could not wake
  anybody.** `argv = []` loaded, startup took the "there is a wake command"
  branch, skipped the entry for want of an argv, and logged `harnesses=0`.

- **Every lifecycle hook announces its session, not just `hook_session`.** The
  announced-session join is how an agent learns the identifier its own harness
  uses, and it is the only source of the thread `[wake.exec]` resumes. The
  Claude Code plugin binds four hook tools and so had one; the Codex plugin
  binds `hook_poll` and only `hook_poll`, so a Codex thread announced nothing
  and the wake command had no thread to resume. `hook_poll` announces too, so a
  harness that binds the obvious single tool gets a working wake path instead of
  a silent no-op. Found by `internal/mcp/e2e/wake_e2e.ts`, which walks the whole
  chain against a real daemon.

- **The second-machine recipe guessed its transport from the address.** An ssh
  forward and a `dibs trust` step both depend on what the daemon serves, and
  both were inferred from where it listens. A LAN daemon with
  `insecure_plaintext = true` was handed an address with no scheme and the
  joiner's bridge re-inferred https against a plaintext port; a loopback daemon
  with a certificate pair also lost its trust step, so the joiner had no way to
  accept the certificate. The recipe is told what is served.

- **The CLI decided its transport from the address alone.** `dibs.toml`
  supports `insecure_plaintext` and an explicit certificate pair, and the daemon
  honours both through the shared resolver; `origin()` looked only at whether
  the host was loopback. A LAN board with `insecure_plaintext = true` was
  contacted over HTTPS, and a loopback board with a certificate over HTTP, by
  `doctor`, `mcp-stdio`, `admin`, `await` and every ordinary request. It asks
  the shared resolver now.

- **One agent named as both coordinator and admin flipped between them** every
  fifteen seconds for the whole startup window, two ledger entries a pass, with
  a gap in which admin-only calls failed. Refused at load.

- **Explicit zero supervision settings, and `nan`, validated and did nothing.**
  `every = "0s"` is not "no limit": the daemon takes these only above zero, so
  it kept the default and nothing said so. `min_duty = nan` passed the range
  check because no comparison against NaN is true. An absent key and an explicit
  zero are the same value in the struct and opposite intentions, so validation
  now asks the decoder which keys were actually written.

- **`mcp-config --board` accepted hosts that cannot become a URL.** The check
  listed forbidden characters, so it caught the ones somebody thought of and
  passed spaces, control characters and invalid escapes. It asks `net/url` the
  same question the failure would ask later.

- **`dibs doctor` ignored the address `dibs configure` wrote.** It built its
  request from the environment alone, so a healthy daemon configured only in
  `dibs.toml` was reported unreachable and every harness was then checked
  against a board that was never running. It resolves the address the same way
  the daemon does, which is what `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` has been promising.

- **One repository failing switched matching off for the whole board.** The
  unreadable-tree and indexing-tree routes were fixed before the tag; the
  ordinary mining and listing failures still replaced the entire global status
  with `off`, while the first repository's scorer stayed installed and went on
  producing results. The board annotated declarations with "matching is off"
  while matching demonstrably worked. The failing tree is named; the phase now
  belongs to the trees that are actually broken.

- **A recovered repository stayed reported as unreadable on the default path.**
  Recovery cleared the diagnosis only on the `ready` phase, which is the phase
  only when a join threshold is configured. The shipped default reports
  `suggest-only`, and a sidecar fallback reports `degraded`, so on an ordinary
  board the operator was told about a permissions problem that had been fixed
  until the daemon restarted.

- **`min_duty` loaded happily at values that could not work.** A negative one
  was ignored and the default silently kept; one above `1` is worse than
  ignored, because the duty check *acquits* a process that clears the
  threshold, so a threshold nothing can clear acquits nobody and every process
  past `min_age` becomes eligible for a stuck verdict. It is a fraction, and it
  is now checked at both ends.

- **`auto_join` was validated against a vocabulary that does not exist.** The
  shared loader accepted `declared`, `predicted` and `off`, while the engine
  implements `declared`, `always` and `never`. So working boards configured
  with `always` or `never` stopped starting, and the error recommended two
  values that silently behave as `declared`. Both vocabularies the loader knows
  are now checked against the engine's own constants.

- **`dibd` could not bind a `DIBS_ADDR` carrying a scheme.** Every other Dibs
  binary accepts one because it says what to speak to a remote board;
  `net.Listen` takes host:port and answered "too many colons in address" after
  the daemon had announced itself. Reading the variable was right, passing its
  scheme to `Listen` was not.

- **The preferred stdio configuration discarded the resolved transport.** The
  bridge rebuilds a scheme from the address alone, so a plaintext daemon off
  loopback was handed a bare address and inferred HTTPS, while the url block
  printed the correct answer. The generator now says the scheme out loud
  whenever the bridge would infer a different one.

- **A refused service install had already created the board directory.** The
  `mkdir` ran before the conflict checks that then refuse, so where a loaded
  unit's directory had been moved or damaged, the command recreated an empty
  board at the old path for the existing job to start against, and then
  reported that it had refused.

- **A failed retry erased the unreadable diagnosis it was reporting.** Scorer
  failure paths publish a repository with no `Unreadable` field, and every such
  status was treated as proof that repository had recovered.

- **The plugin still promised delivery the engine refuses.** `UserPromptSubmit`
  never delivers to the model, and `Stop` does not under `wake = none`, a
  repeated wake, or `stop_hook_active`, so mail arriving after the preceding
  Stop can be absent for a whole turn. The pitch says what the hooks buy and
  what still makes delivery certain.

- **A wildcard bind produced a certificate no client could verify.** The
  wizard's "this machine and others" writes `0.0.0.0`, so the generated
  certificate carried IP SAN `0.0.0.0` and DNS SAN `localhost` and nothing
  else. `mcp-config` then correctly refuses to hand anybody a listen address
  and substitutes this machine's LAN address, which was not in the
  certificate: one unusable answer traded for another. A wildcard bind now
  covers the machine's own addresses. Where none can be detected, the command
  refuses rather than printing `<this-machine>` inside an otherwise complete
  configuration.

- **A URL was accepted as the daemon's listen address.** `addr =
  "https://127.0.0.1:4777"` passed the loader and produced a confident HTTPS
  configuration, while `dibd` hands that value to `net.Listen`, which cannot
  bind a URL. Two grammars were being checked by one validator: a scheme is
  valid on a client's `DIBS_ADDR` and never on an address a daemon binds.

- **More settings that read as applied and were not**: a negative blob store,
  a negative match history, a match deadline that is not a duration, an
  `auto_join` value naming nothing, and negative supervision intervals. Each
  loaded cleanly while the daemon refused or silently ignored it.

- **A recovered repository still stayed reported unreadable.** The failure
  records the agent's working directory and the recovery reports the
  repository root it resolved to, so comparing exactly removed a path nothing
  had recorded. It drops by containment now. The test used one path for both
  ends, which is why the first fix looked right.

- **`E_MSG_FINAL` pointed at a human mailbox that may not exist.** The human
  row is created when the operator first acts, so a headless board has none.

- **Three test defects.** `holdsRole` asked whether an agent held a role by
  calling `GrantRole`, which GRANTS it: every authorization assertion in that
  file rested on a probe that mutated what it inspected. The self-promotion
  test asserted the effect only inside `if err == nil`, so an op that returned
  success while doing nothing passed. And the unreadable-tree test used the
  same path for failure and recovery.

- **The shared config loader validated keys but not values.** It rejected an
  unknown key and stopped there, while the daemon goes on to check that
  durations parse and clear a floor, that ceilings are neither negative nor
  mutually contradictory, and that the wake policy names something. So
  `[limits] agent_ttl = "10"` and `[wake] extend_turn_for = "everything"` both
  loaded here and stopped `dibd`: the same success-that-is-false the shared
  package was created to end, found one round after creating it. The checks
  moved in with the type; what stays with the daemon is the part that needs its
  own defaults, and the comment no longer claims otherwise.

- **`doctor` could not reach its own damaged-ledger diagnosis.** It returned as
  soon as the daemon was unreachable, and a corrupt ledger is usually WHY the
  daemon is unreachable: the operator got "daemon unreachable" and nothing
  else, while the check that names the broken record and says not to delete the
  file sat behind that return. Everything that reads this machine's own files
  now runs when the daemon is down, which is when it matters.

- **A configured local board that lost its daemon files still read as a join.**
  `dibs.toml` is what `dibs configure` writes for a board of its own, and a
  joining directory has no daemon to configure, so its absence from the
  daemon-owned list meant the wizard's ordinary output was mistaken for
  somebody else's board the moment its ledger went missing.

- **A mistyped scheme was refused on one path only.** `DIBS_ADDR=htps://…`
  exited 0 and emitted the typo as both the bridge's address and the MCP url;
  `--board` had rejected exactly that since the last round. One validator now
  serves both, split so the rule that only applies to a board you DIAL (a
  wildcard is a legitimate bind address, and the wizard writes one) does not
  refuse this daemon's own configuration.

- **Two more false delivery promises.** The claude-code plugin's setup step
  still told an operator mail appears "on your next tool call" and blamed a
  PreToolUse hook when it did not, and `send`'s description told every harness
  it reaches a recipient at a turn boundary, which is untrue for Codex, where
  nothing invokes Dibs automatically. The guard added last round read only the
  plugin's summary; it reads every published string now, and refuses that
  phrase by name.

- **`doctor` could call a damaged local TLS board a healthy join.** The
  daemon-owned artifact list omitted `tls-key.pem` and `admin.hash`. A joining
  client holds the board's public certificate and never either of those, so a
  board that had lost its ledger, node id, key and blobs while keeping one of
  them read as a join and skipped the check that would have reported the loss.

- **A repository stayed reported unreadable after its permissions recovered.**
  Unreadable trees survive a phase change on purpose, but the preserve kept the
  whole list and no production caller ever sends the empty slice that clears
  it, so the diagnosis could not be retracted without a restart. A successful
  index now drops that one tree and leaves every other.

- **Every generated Codex configuration supplied half of the documented MCP
  2026 requirement**, omitting `[features] mcp_2026_07_28 = true`, so operators
  following it stayed on the legacy protocol while the prose said otherwise.
  The README also contradicted itself about whether the flag does anything.

- **An unresolvable home directory produced a confident recipe rooted at
  `/home/you`.** On a headless host `mcp-config --board` printed mkdir, scp,
  trust and JSON all targeting a literal path that is nobody's home, with
  nothing saying it was a stand-in. It refuses now.

- **The Codex plugin guide opened by recommending the transport the rest of it
  argues against**, "a plain MCP server over HTTP: no bridge", ahead of a page
  explaining why the per-session bridge is what holds the nonce.

- **The documented release guarantee was not true of the pipeline.**
  `AGENTS.md` said nothing between the tag and the release needs a person; the
  Homebrew cask does, because the tap requires a pull request and the deploy
  key can push but cannot call the API. Until that branch is merged the release
  is out and `brew upgrade` serves the previous build. Said plainly now, and
  the release job prints what is still owed.

- **Three regression guards passed against the behaviour they named.** The
  space-id one rebuilt the corrected expression and compared it with itself;
  the enrichment one read a session sidecar that was not there and checked the
  universal fields instead; the continuity one searched for `resumed`,
  `reattached` and `ROTATED` separately, so swapping the two token rules left
  it green while telling a client to keep a dead token. Each now drives the
  production path, and each was verified by restoring the exact regression and
  watching it fail.

Acting on an independent operator evaluation of v0.0.6, which ran Dibs across two
machines for real work. Their priority order, not ours.


- **An agent on a terminal host could not show the board it was reading.**
  `board` renders to an MCP Apps panel, and a host that renders none fell back to
  one line, "3 agent(s), 1 active", while `dibs board` on the same machine
  printed the board. The fallback is now the board itself, bounded at 20 rows.
  Only where no panel is declared: on a panel host the human is already looking
  at it.

- **`doctor` called a joined board a corrupt ledger.** A data directory that
  joins another machine's board holds a credential; the ledger is on the hub. It
  reported "ledger does not verify ... do NOT delete it, open an issue", a
  data-loss emergency raised against a healthy join, at the operator least able
  to tell it was spurious. Found by following the new join recipe end to end.

- **`dibs configure --service` could not install on a fresh machine.** It wrote
  the unit without creating the data directory the unit names, so the service
  failed at start with nothing pointing at the cause.

- **`doctor` reported a configured suggest-only matcher as a warning**, so a
  deliberate `join_threshold = 0` looked like a fault on every run.

- **`dibs prune` answered "did you mean dibs probe".** The CLI verbs and the
  MCP tools are different sets and nothing mapped them, so a name that is a
  real Dibs verb on the other surface was answered with the nearest unrelated
  word. The CLI now says which surface it lives on. Its copy of the tool names
  is held to the server's listing by a test.

- **`dibs configure` needed a terminal**, and the machines that most need
  configuring are headless and reached by `ssh host command`. A second machine
  in a fleet hit this on its first command. `--non-interactive` takes the
  defaults, writes the file and prints what it wrote. It refuses to overwrite
  an existing config, since there is no prompt on that path to catch it.

- **`dibs upgrade --help` now says it does not fetch.** It moves the running
  daemon onto a build already installed, which is what it should do and not
  what its name suggests; run bare on an up-to-date install it correctly does
  nothing, and that reads as a failure.

- **Five things the pre-release review caught in the above**, before any of it
  shipped: the README copied the board secret to a directory the generated
  configuration did not use, so the documented setup ended at a bridge that
  could not start; `--board` printed no `dibs trust` step for a board that is
  not on loopback, so the configuration looked complete and the bridge would
  reject the certificate; two boards on different ports of one host shared a
  credential directory, so joining the second overwrote the first; `doctor`
  keyed "this is a join" on a missing `node_id` alone, so a local board that
  lost that file but still held a ledger skipped verification and was reported
  healthy; and the successful-claim log still said "claimed by the agent that
  started this daemon", the same false attribution the startup line was
  corrected for, on the record of a privileged role being taken.

- **Two more from the review's second round**: `dibs configure <dir>
  --non-interactive --help` wrote the configuration and ignored the help
  request, which is the third instance of the shape this command's own
  comments document (`configure --service --help` wrote a LaunchAgent, `dibs
  stop --help` stopped the daemon) and the first where a flag added for
  unattended use turned an ignored argument into a silent write. `configure`
  now reads every argument before deciding anything, and refuses an unknown
  flag or a second directory. And the credential directory rewrote dots to
  hyphens, so `hub.example` and `hub-example` shared one: the port collision
  again in another character. Dots are kept.

- **Four more from the review's third round.** The generated `dibs trust`
  command omitted the board's `DIBS_DIR`, so it recorded the certificate under
  the default data directory, reported success, and the bridge went on
  rejecting the board: a step that looks done and is not. The recipe hard-coded
  the hub's secret at `~/.dibs/local.secret`, which only the hub knows and
  which is the wrong board's credential on a hub that runs two. The directory
  key still collided between an IPv6 literal and a hostname spelled like one.
  And `prune` refused self-pruning in its description while its `agent`
  parameter still offered "yours", so an agent reading both was told to make a
  call that cannot succeed.

- **Four more from the review's fourth round.** The hub-side recipe and the
  README still printed `dibs trust` bare after sending the joining bridge to a
  directory of its own, which is round three's bug in the other two places it
  is written. The generated shell lines did not quote the derived path, so a
  home directory containing a space split into two arguments. The
  `claim_coordinator` tool still offered the role to "the agent that started
  this daemon", which under a service manager is nobody, and a tool description
  is the only documentation an agent reads: that can leave a service-managed
  board with no coordinator. And the truncated text board said the rest was
  "in this result" when it is in `_meta`, which is exactly what the model on a
  no-panel host cannot see, so it pointed an agent at rows it could not reach
  and would have had it report them as present.

- **Three more from the review's fifth round**, and the credential directory
  is now keyed on the address verbatim. It collided four times, once per
  round, each fix keeping one more character while the comment above it went
  on claiming every board gets its own: the port was dropped for non-loopback,
  then dots became hyphens, then loopback was renamed "board" and collided
  with the ordinary hostname `board`. The pattern was rewriting the address
  into something that reads nicely, and every such rewrite maps two addresses
  onto one name somewhere. Also: the certificate-refused recovery message told
  an operator to run `dibs trust` without the data directory their failing
  call was using, and the `scp` source was quoted on the half this machine
  controls but not the hub's.

- **Five more from the review's sixth round.** `mcp-config` printed a
  complete-looking stdio configuration that named no address or data
  directory, so an operator running a second daemon got a config for the
  first, reading its secret and its nonce file and joining a board they were
  not asking about. Merging that into the Codex form then produced two
  `env = { ... }` lines in one TOML table, which is a duplicate key: one line
  now, protocol version included. The ssh recipe used this machine's port as
  the hub's, so a forward printed for a board on 5777 pointed at a hub that
  listens on 4777; the local end is named as the joining machine's choice.
  Addresses in pasteable commands were unquoted, and an IPv6 literal is a glob
  in zsh. And `mcp-config` ignored everything after its first positional
  argument, so `mcp-config junk --board hub:4777` printed the local
  configuration and never read the flag.

- **Four more from the review's seventh round.** The forward still used one
  port for both its ends, so `--board 127.0.0.1:5777` could not express a hub
  on 4777; the far port is the hub's to name now. The note on pinning an
  identity told the reader to add a second `env = { ... }` line, which is the
  duplicate TOML key the round before had just removed. `nonDefaultEnv` read
  the address through a helper that strips an explicit scheme, so a
  deliberately plaintext daemon off loopback handed the bridge bare
  `host:port` and the bridge inferred HTTPS. And the hub-side recipe's
  pasteable commands were still unquoted.

- **Three more from the review's eighth round**, and the address's shape is now
  decided in one place. The second-machine recipe still handed the bridge an
  address with the scheme removed, and the branch choosing between a forward
  and a certificate could not read a scheme at all, so a board explicitly named
  as plaintext was told to record a certificate it does not serve. A scheme,
  when the operator writes one, settles what the daemon serves; without one,
  loopback means a forward and anything else means HTTPS. The README's tunnel
  example also still used one port for both ends, in the paragraph that
  describes a machine already running its own board on that port.

- **Two more from the review's ninth round.** `dibs mcp-config --board` was
  refused on a machine with no terminal: the admin gate ran before the flag was
  parsed, so the invocation documented for a second machine, which is typically
  headless and driven by `ssh host command`, printed "needs an interactive
  terminal" and nothing else. `--board` prints a config for somebody else's
  board and reads no secret of this machine's, so it is not what that gate
  protects; the plain form, which prints this daemon's secret, still is. And
  the generated `dibs trust` carried a scheme, which reaches `tls.Dial` as part
  of the host and fails with "too many colons in address": the scheme belongs
  in `DIBS_ADDR`, not in a command that dials.

- **Two more from the review's tenth round.** A board can need BOTH a forward
  and a certificate recorded, and the branch printing step two was a switch, so
  a forwarded HTTPS board got the forward and no trust step: a
  complete-looking configuration that then rejects the certificate. An
  uppercase scheme was also read as plaintext. And the new build-without-mise
  section stopped at `bin/` before telling the reader to run `dibd`, which on
  a fresh machine is command-not-found and on an existing one silently runs
  the previous build; the install step is written out, Launch Services
  registration included.

- **Three more from the review's eleventh round**, the first of them a leak
  introduced by the round before it. Waiving the interactive gate for
  `--board` was scoped to the flag appearing rather than to it having a value,
  so `dibs mcp-config --board=` waived the gate, parsed as empty, fell through
  to the local form and printed this daemon's secret on a headless machine,
  exiting 0. An empty `--board` is refused now, and the waiver requires a
  value. The install recipe also never created `~/.local/bin`, and copied the
  two macOS-only artifacts unconditionally, so it failed on Linux.

- **Four more from the review's twelfth round.** The ordinary `mcp-config`
  recipe still decided the second machine's setup from "did this daemon make a
  certificate", which answers neither of the two questions it has: an HTTPS
  board on loopback needs a forward and a certificate recorded and got only
  the forward, and a board explicitly named `http://` off loopback was called
  loopback and told to tunnel. It reads the address now, as `--board` does. An
  explicit scheme also outranks the certificate file when naming the url. The
  no-panel board dropped `display_name`, which exists because a name that is
  not Latin collapses to a generic id, and silently showed one of an agent's
  declarations; it shows the name, the id, and how many it did not show. Two
  tests of ours were also named for regressions they could not catch, and now
  drive the gate and the wizard rather than the helpers beside them.

- **Three more from the review's thirteenth round.** `dibs configure` writes
  the operator's listen-address choice to `dibs.toml` and ends by telling them
  to run `dibs mcp-config`, which read only `DIBS_ADDR` and so printed a
  configuration for `127.0.0.1:4777`: a confident answer about the wrong
  daemon, from the command the wizard had just sent them to. It reads the
  configured address now, and maps a wildcard bind to something dialable,
  since `0.0.0.0` is a listen address and not one anybody can connect to. The
  second-machine recipe also handed the joining machine THIS daemon's loopback
  address, which on that machine is its own board, in the same output that
  then explains the local end of a forward is that machine's choice. And a
  left-behind `tls-cert.pem` was read as proof of TLS, so a daemon moved back
  to loopback or switched to `insecure_plaintext` was still described as
  serving HTTPS, with instructions to trust a certificate it does not present.

- **Three more from the review's fourteenth round.** The environment handed to
  a bridge still read the address the way that ignores `dibs.toml`, so a daemon
  configured onto a LAN address or a non-default port had its stdio configs
  printed with no address at all and the bridge dialled the default; the url
  block had been fixed a round earlier and this had not. `--board` accepted
  anything non-empty, including a mistyped scheme, which it then classified as
  plaintext and emitted verbatim, and a wildcard listen address no client can
  dial; both exited 0 around a configuration that cannot work. And a
  `dibs.toml` that does not parse was read as no configuration at all, so the
  daemon would refuse to start while this printed a confident config for the
  default address.

- **Five more from the review's fifteenth round.** `--board` did not check
  that the port was a port, and the port goes into the credential directory's
  name: `hub:4777/../../escaped` produced a `mkdir -p /Users/escaped` with a
  secret written into it, and exited 0. The transport was still decided by
  whether `tls-cert.pem` exists, ignoring `insecure_plaintext` and a
  configured `tls_cert`, so a daemon configured for plaintext beside a
  left-behind certificate was described as serving HTTPS. A `dibs.toml` with a
  key `dibd` does not know parses as valid TOML and makes the daemon refuse to
  start, while this printed a configuration for the default address.
  `configure --non-interactive <dir>` then told the operator to run bare
  `dibs configure --service` and `dibd`, both of which act on the DEFAULT data
  directory, so the advertised sequence configured one board and started
  another. And `doctor` called any directory with a secret and no `node_id` or
  ledger a healthy join, including a local board that had lost both but still
  held the key it encrypts with: a directory that has lost its replayable
  state, reported as nothing wrong.

- **The rule for what a daemon serves now lives in one place**, after the
  review's sixteenth round found the CLI's copy of it wrong a third time: a
  leftover certificate made it print HTTPS for a loopback daemon, which serves
  plaintext however many certificates are lying around; `insecure_plaintext`
  was allowed to beat an explicit certificate pair, which the daemon honours
  first; and a `tls_cert` with no `tls_key` was treated as authoritative,
  pointing clients at a certificate the daemon never presents. `dibd` and
  `dibs mcp-config` both call `internal/transport` now. The unknown-key check
  also covered only top-level keys, so `[match] typo_threshold` was fine here
  while `dibd -check` exits 1 on it; the key list is complete and a test reads
  the daemon's own structs, nested tables included, so it cannot drift.

- **`send` promised a wake it cannot deliver.** Its own description said
  question, request and handoff "WAKE the recipient now". They do not: mail is
  pushed by `hook_poll`, which the shipped plugins bind to SessionStart,
  UserPromptSubmit, Stop and SubagentStop, so an agent in the middle of a long
  turn has no event for one to arrive on and sees it when the turn ends.
  `WAKE-MECHANISMS.md` says exactly this under "Honest limits"; the tool
  description, which is the only thing an agent reads, did not. Found when a
  peer sent a question with the default 600-second deadline to an agent working
  a seven-hour autonomous stretch, got "recipient is dormant" back, and
  reported the product broken. The description now says when a message actually
  arrives and what a short deadline costs.

- **`register` failed outright for any Claude Code session with
  `CLAUDE_EFFORT` set.** The stdio bridge fills in identity it can observe, and
  that table is applied to `register` and nothing else. It carried an entry for
  `effort`, which is an `update` field: `register` does not declare it, and
  since v0.0.6 refuses unknown arguments rather than ignoring them, injecting it
  did not add a field, it failed the call with `-32602 register does not take
  "effort"`. No agent was created at all, so no lifecycle hook could resolve
  that session, no mail reached it, and its claim guard returned allow.
  Reproduced against the shipped v0.0.6 binary with the environment of a live
  session. A test now holds every field the bridge injects to `register`'s
  actual schema.

- **The claude-code plugin advertised a delivery moment it does not bind.**
  Its catalogue entry said a PreToolUse hook calls the wake path, so mail
  "appears in your context on your next tool call". PreToolUse binds the claim
  guard and nothing else. That text is what an agent reads when deciding
  whether it still needs to poll, so the one claim that overstates is the one
  that loses mail. A test now holds every plugin's pitch to the events its own
  `hooks.json` actually binds `hook_poll` to.

- **`E_MSG_FINAL` carried no hint**, in breach of the rule that every error
  names the corrective call, and it is the error an agent hits exactly when it
  has come back late to something it missed. It now names the corrective call:
  `send` a new message to that agent, and if they are gone, `check_in` for who
  is on the board now.

- **README: building without mise or task.** On a network that allows the Go
  module proxy but not the object store it redirects to, neither tool installs
  and the failure reads like a broken toolchain rather than a blocked host.
  Dibs itself still builds, because every step is a `go build` or a `go run
  ./tools/...` in-tree. The four commands are written down, along with the two
  install rules that are not obvious from them: remove before copying, because
  macOS caches a signature verdict against the inode, and set the codesign
  identifiers, which the Go toolchain leaves as `a.out`.

- **An approval was lost if the board restarted before the asker heard it.** A
  blocking notice is what reaches an agent that asked for something and then
  stopped waiting, and it existed only in memory, created by live event
  processing. A daemon restarting between the approval and that agent's next
  turn boundary therefore lost it outright: the grant stayed ledgered and
  correct, `hook_poll`, `[wake.exec]` and `check_in` all saw nothing, and the
  agent waited indefinitely for news that had already happened. Notices are
  ephemeral by design and the architecture's rule is that such a view must be
  rebuildable; nothing rebuilt this one. It is rebuilt from state rather than
  from the event ring, because a terminal message its asker has not consumed is
  exactly the set still owed and cannot drift from what the ring happens to
  still hold.

  **It does not re-arm `[wake.exec]`.** The notice is waiting when the agent
  next calls in, and nothing starts a process to bring it back: wake evaluation
  happens when an event is published, and a rebuild publishes none. Issue #75
  is where that half is being worked.

  The first version keyed on `Message.Consumed`, which is about the other
  party: the RECIPIENT consumes a message when they answer it, so every verdict
  is consumed the instant it exists and nothing was rebuilt at all. Its unit
  test set that field by hand and passed. What found it was running a real
  daemon, from the built archive, and restarting it: `task test:human` does that
  now, because a fixture a test wrote itself can only confirm the assumption in
  the fixture.

- **The published Stop-hook verification could not fail.** The Codex plugin
  tells an operator to call `spawned_agents` before and after a turn and
  compare, and it said to look for "the entry changing": `since_seconds` and
  `seen_seconds` are computed with `time.Since` on every read, so the entry
  changes because time passed. Somebody whose Stop hook never reached the daemon
  could follow the procedure exactly and be told delivery works, which is the
  worst possible outcome for a step people run when they already suspect a
  problem. It names `state`, which is the field a lifecycle event actually
  moves, and the value to look for.

- **A long space name opened no space, and said it had.** The generated id was
  truncated to the limit and then retried at the same length, so all four
  attempts collided with the same existing space: the declaration succeeded
  while the space it promised was never opened. The retry suffix is preserved
  now.

- **The board panel's human control said "act as yourself".** It reads the
  board and it does not act, and the two are separate capabilities: the panel
  renders in the human's UI but speaks over the agent's connection, so reading
  it is not authority to do anything. The control says "confirm it's you", and
  the panel explains the distinction rather than leaving it to be inferred from
  a button.

- **An established role pin outranked the operator's current configuration.**
  The pin records which identity a standing role was granted to, so that the
  same NAME cannot later be taken by a different agent. Once it existed, the
  check returned success on the pin alone and never looked at
  `[roles.identity]` again, so neither way of withdrawing an authorisation had
  any effect on the next grant: deleting the entry re-granted the agent anyway,
  and pointing it at a successor re-granted the predecessor beside them. Each
  restart passed the new configuration in, was told yes, and re-granted the old
  identity, which for admin is every decrypted mailbox on the board restored
  against the operator's written instruction. The pin is a floor now, not a
  grant: both the pin and the current configuration have to name the agent.

  **A refused grant is not a demotion.** A role is replayable state, so an agent
  that already holds one keeps it until something takes it away, and nothing in
  the reconciler does: it only ever grants. So the sequence is two steps, and
  saying so is the point of this paragraph: edit the config, then `dibs admin
  member <agent>`. Making the config sufficient on its own means the reconciler
  demoting agents it did not grant this run, which is a change to how standing
  privilege is withdrawn rather than a wording fix: issue #73 has the edges that
  make it worth doing deliberately rather than in the hour before a tag.

- **The wake path's long-turn ordering is exercised end to end.** Every
  recorder in the wake suite exited at once, so what happens *during* a turn was
  answered only by unit tests calling the pieces in the order the author
  expected, and three defects lived in that gap: mail arriving after the woken
  agent read its inbox was discarded, then it was recorded and the re-check
  could not get past the same test, then the two facts the exit produces were
  published separately and a message landing between them saw neither. The
  suite now runs a recorder that checks in like a real agent, keeps running,
  checks in again, and exits. Verified by disabling each fix in turn and
  watching it fail: the first attempt disabled one of the two places the
  arrival is recorded and passed, which is the same redundancy the burst check
  has.

- **A verdict now reaches an agent whatever `notices_wake` says.** An answer, an
  approval, a denial or a decline is the reply to something that agent asked and
  then stopped for, so it is treated as blocking: counted separately, delivered
  at `urgent`, and not suppressed by `notices_wake = false`. That is an
  operator-visible change to what a configuration switch does and it was never
  announced; `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` still named an approved request as an
  example of what the setting governs, so somebody turning it off to save tokens
  would have expected to stop hearing the one thing they cannot afford to miss.

- **`dibs fingerprint` could fingerprint the wrong certificate.** It always read
  the managed `tls-cert.pem`, and a board with `tls_cert` configured serves
  something else: the command either reported no certificate or fingerprinted a
  stale auto-generated chain. On the one command whose entire purpose is
  comparing what is served against what another machine pinned, and whose
  mismatch message says something other than your daemon is answering.

- **A wildcard bind was published as a client's destination.** `DIBS_ADDR` was
  copied verbatim into every generated configuration, because the scheme it may
  carry cannot be inferred, so a daemon started with `:4777` or `0.0.0.0:4777`
  told its clients to dial the address it LISTENS on. `:4777` has no host in it
  at all. It goes through the same resolver the configuration branch beside it
  has always used, which keeps the scheme.

- **Two guards enforced less than they claimed.** The workflow shell check
  described multiple statements, pipelines, redirections, substitutions and
  control flow as forbidden and tested nine substrings: `cmd1; cmd2` passed, so
  did an unspaced pipeline, a single `>`, a backtick, a `while` loop, and a
  block of two ordinary commands. And the e2e suite count counted TASKS, so a
  task running two suites counted as one and the documented number could stay
  green while the gate ran an extra. Both now check the property they state, and
  the shell one distinguishes a folded block, whose lines are one command, from
  a literal one, whose lines are several.

- **The README's opening line said Dibs never acts.** Two things in this release
  act, both because somebody asked: approving a `request` carrying `grant` or
  `adopt` performs that change, which is the point of approving it, and
  `[wake.exec]` runs a command from the operator's own config. It still never
  decides what an agent does next, which is the part that mattered, and saying
  the broader thing made the narrower one unbelievable.

- **A permission hint was chosen by folder rather than by failure.** Anything
  under `~/Desktop`, `~/Documents` or `~/Downloads` that matching could not read
  was told it was a macOS protected-folder problem, and advised to move the
  checkout or grant the daemon Full Disk Access. A directory that simply has no
  `.git` got the same advice, with the real answer sitting in the error text
  beside it. Both remedies are heavier than the fix and one of them moves a
  working tree for nothing. The distinguishing symptom was already written in
  that function's own comment and not used: the protected-folder case makes git
  BLOCK, so it presents as a deadline, and a clean fast answer from git means
  git ran. Reported by an agent that followed the advice.

- **`dibs upgrade` could leave the old daemon running and call it upgraded.**
  Two independent signals say something is running: a request to the board, and
  the registry the daemon writes for itself. Cutover consulted only the first,
  so any transient failure of that one request skipped the stop entirely: the
  replacement started, exited at once on the directory lock the original still
  holds, and the original went on answering. Verification then found a board,
  had no pre-upgrade serial to compare it against, and printed `upgraded:` for
  the process the command exists to replace. With `--adopt-dir` the data
  directory is renamed under that live writer as well. A registered daemon is
  stopped whether or not it answered a moment ago.

- **`dibs upgrade` could rewrite another board's service unit.** The function
  that decides which unit belongs to this board asked `strings.Contains`, so a
  unit for `~/.dibs-old` was accepted as the unit for `~/.dibs` and then
  rewritten and reloaded. `--adopt-dir` renames a directory to exactly that
  shape, which makes the two most likely to collide the two most likely to be
  present. The exact-token matcher was already in the same package, written for
  this question, with the tests that prove a substring is wrong; it simply was
  not called here.

- **The approval panel showed the Approve button and not the reason.** Two
  carriers arrive for the same state: `_meta` holds a body-redacted copy,
  because it travels through hosts that put tool results in front of the model,
  and the content beside it holds the readable answer the panel asked for with
  its own token. The panel preferred the redacted one in all three paths, so a
  request card kept its grant, its adopt and its Approve button and showed no
  body at all, and a question lost its declared choices. That is the worst
  version of this surface: it asks somebody to decide with the deciding part
  removed. The redacted copy still decides which messages there are, because it
  is also the filtered one; the readable copy fills in what redaction emptied.
  All 88 panel checks passed against the unreadable state, because they counted
  messages and read action labels and never looked at the text.

- **An unauthorised admin alias took a valid coordinator grant down with it.**
  The one-agent-one-role rule collected every admin alias that RESOLVED and
  skipped a coordinator naming the same agent, and resolving is not being
  authorised: with the admin spelling absent from `[roles.identity]`, the valid
  coordinator grant was skipped for an admin grant that was then refused, so
  nothing was granted. The launch claim stays suppressed either way, because the
  config does name a coordinator, so a fresh board came up with no coordinator
  and no way to get one: the state the claim exists to prevent, produced by the
  fix for a different defect. Admin runs first and reports what it actually did,
  and only an agent holding admin suppresses its own coordinator declaration.

- **The documented role handover left the predecessor holding the role.**
  `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` said to install the successor's fingerprint and delete
  the old pin, and omitted the demotion: a role already held is replayable state
  that nothing in the reconciler takes away, so an operator following the guide
  believed the role had moved while the predecessor went on reading every
  mailbox. It is three steps now, with the demotion first, which is the wrong
  thing for a security document to have been quiet about.

- **The only test protecting the cancelled-Touch-ID verdict never ran.** It
  skipped unless the presence helper happened to sit beside the Go test binary,
  which neither the ordinary gate nor `-tags dibdev` arranges, so reverting
  "cancelled means abandoned" to "cancelled means declined" left everything
  green. That distinction is the whole point of the package: a decline is a
  claim about a person, and nobody was asked. The decision is split from the
  plumbing and tested directly, which is what this package already did once for
  the same reason.

- **`WAKE-MECHANISMS.md` called a shipped protocol path "not built".** Legacy
  `resources/subscribe` and the GET SSE notification space were written up as
  the next bet, the bet was taken, and the sentence stayed: an integrator
  reading it goes looking for an alternative to something that is already here.

- **The wake tests raced the wakes they caused.** `maybeWake` starts a
  goroutine, and seventeen assertions read the maps that goroutine writes
  without taking the lock that guards them. Every local run passed and CI went
  red once, which is how a race behaves and why it took a gate on another
  machine to show it. The production locking was correct on both sides; only
  the tests were wrong, and a red release gate nobody can reproduce is its own
  kind of defect.

- **`dibs doctor` called the correct shipped Codex hook broken.** Teaching the
  scanner to read both plugin layouts without teaching it that they address
  servers differently made it judge every file against the Claude Code spelling:
  a Codex hook correctly naming `dibs` was reported as pointed at a server that
  does not exist, with "reinstall the plugin" as the remedy, which cannot fix a
  file that is already right. A second warning then listed the tools the daemon
  does not serve, with the list empty. Both fixed, and the guard runs the
  scanner from the repository root, because the first version of it ran in the
  package directory, scanned nothing, and passed.

- **One agent could hold two roles by being spelled two ways.** The validator
  refuses the same string in both role lists, and a name and an id are two
  strings for one agent: `coordinator = ["fleet-lead"]` beside `admin = ["Fleet
  Lead"]` passed and resolved to one identity, so every reconciliation granted
  coordinator and then admin. Two ledger entries every fifteen seconds and a
  window in between where admin-only calls fail, which is the oscillation the
  validator's own message says it prevents. Decided after resolution now, where
  aliases are visible, and admin wins because it already includes what
  coordinator can do.

- **A wake exit at the same instant as a check-in was ignored.** The turn end is
  compared against the last contact with a strict `After`, and both come from
  `time.Now()`: an agent that called in and exited within the same clock tick
  looked like it was still running, so the next message was refused. It also
  made a test fail once at the release gate and pass two thousand times after,
  which is what a race nobody can reproduce looks like from the outside.

- **Board credentials were minted even when the OS random source failed.** The
  error from `crypto/rand` was discarded and the buffer returned regardless, so
  a failing RNG produced a zero or half-filled bootstrap token, session token
  and page key, and authentication continued with them. Both mints refuse now,
  and both HTTP handlers report the refusal: returning 200 with an empty token
  spends the operator's fingerprint on an answer that grants nothing and calls
  it success, and a handler whose failure depends on the caller noticing is not
  one that refuses.

- **A strict hook's dropped keys were logged where the daemon does not look.**
  The Codex strict schema cannot carry `agent` and `queued`, and the comment
  said the distinction they encode is kept in the daemon log. It used `Debug`,
  and the daemon starts at `Info`, so the record was dropped by the handler: a
  strict hook returned `{}` with nothing anywhere to separate "news is queued
  and this event could not carry it" from "there was nothing to say".

- **The Codex documentation contradicted itself about what Codex can do.**
  Several current-facing pages still described it as legacy-only, pull-only, on
  HTTP, or unable to run `mcp_tool` hooks, in some cases a few lines from the
  correction. The measured tables keep their dates and now point at what is
  true; the claims that read as current say what current builds do.

- **`dibs upgrade` could not read the service unit Dibs itself writes.**
  `configure --service` emits `ExecStart` through a quoter that wraps the value
  and doubles a backslash, a quote, a `%` and a `$`; the reader split on quotes
  and whitespace and reversed none of it. So `-dir "/tmp/Fleet Review"` came
  back as two tokens, neither matching the board, and the unit describing this
  very daemon read as another board's: upgrade started a detached process
  instead of the service, printed a warning, and accepted the result. The board
  comes back and systemd is no longer supervising it across logout or reboot.
  Any path holding a space, a `%`, a `$` or a backslash was affected. The reader
  parses what the writer emits now, and its test round-trips through the real
  writer rather than a hand-written unit, because the defect was exactly that
  the two disagreed.

- **A configured certificate was judged against an address that may not win.**
  Moving the hostname check to startup was right and left the old one at config
  load, where `-addr` and `DIBS_ADDR` are both invisible: a board whose
  `dibs.toml` names one address and which is started on another refused to load
  at all, holding a certificate that was correct for the address it was told to
  serve. That is worse than the hole it closed, and this changelog said in as
  many words that the check cannot live there. It is asked once, after the
  address is resolved, for both startup and `dibd -check`.

- **A failed fallback space was reported as "no join threshold is set".** The
  matching-status hint took precedence, and one exists for every non-ready
  phase, including the suggest-only phase a zero join threshold produces, which
  is the default. So on an ordinary board the agent got a true but irrelevant
  sentence and never the relevant one: nothing matched, no space was opened,
  and there is nowhere for the next agent to find it. That is the misreading
  the outcome was added to prevent, previously only reachable on a board
  configured in a way most are not.

- **Two parallel boards logged each other out.** The session cookie was named
  `dibs_session` on every board, and cookies are scoped to a host and never to
  a port, so each redemption silently overwrote the other's. `-allow-parallel`
  exists so an operator can run separate boards for agents they do not trust
  together, and their two web interfaces could not both stay signed in: the
  older tab kept its own port-scoped page key and started sending the newer
  board's session token, so its stream revalidation and every keyed request
  failed with nothing on screen to explain it. The name carries the port now.
  That fixes the collision and changes nothing about the exposure `SECURITY.md`
  describes: a different name is the same jar, sent to the same host, by the
  same browser.

- **The Codex plugin's hooks were outside the test that checks hook arguments.**
  `TestShippedHooksSatisfyTheSchemasTheyCall` globbed `plugins/*/hooks/hooks.json`
  and said in a comment that Codex uses that layout. It does not: Codex reads a
  `hooks.json` at the root of its config directory, which is how the plugin
  ships it. So the one plugin whose hooks carry required parameters was the one
  the required-parameter test could not see, and removing `session_id` from
  every Codex hook would have left it green. `dibs doctor` scanned the same
  single layout and printed the all-clear over the same blind spot. Both read
  both layouts now.

- **A retired agent shadowed its live successor in `[roles]`.** A name is the
  first agent's id, so when `fleet-lead` retires and a replacement registers
  under the same name it becomes `fleet-lead-2`. Resolution matched the exact id
  first and did not ask whether that agent was gone, where the by-name branch
  beside it always had: the documented handover therefore resolved the
  predecessor forever, the pin refused it, and the board never got the
  coordinator its config names. It fails closed, which is the right direction
  and is still a board without its coordinator.

- **The rebuilt verdict notices were ordered by the wrong serial.** The notice
  carries the serial of the *verdict*, and the rebuild sorted by the serial of
  the *request*, so a very old question answered a moment ago was inserted
  first, where the sixteen-notice trim discards it, while older verdicts for
  newer requests survived. That is the reverse of the "newest win" the trim
  promises. Only visible with more than sixteen owed at once.

- **The board could report itself unlocked while discarding its only
  credential.** The page key arrives in the redirect's fragment, is written to
  `localStorage`, and the fragment is then erased. The write was wrapped in a
  `catch` that swallowed the failure, so where storage is unavailable and
  cookies still work the document and `/events` loaded and every keyed request
  went without the header: an unlocked board with an empty mailbox and buttons
  that do nothing, and nothing on screen saying why. The tab keeps it in memory
  as well, which is enough for the session it was minted for.

- **The Codex Stop verification asked for something an agent cannot do.**
  Correcting it to name the `state` field was right and not sufficient: a tool
  call requires a turn, and an agent's next turn opens with `SessionStart`,
  which puts `state` back to `running` before it can look. It has to be a
  *second* agent that reads `spawned_agents` while the first is between turns.
  The shipped plugin README was worse and said that being listed at all proves a
  Stop arrived, which `SessionStart` alone also achieves.

- **`AGENTS.md` prescribed a release command that refuses.** It named a literal
  `task release VERSION=0.0.6`, and 0.0.6 is the version already tagged, so the
  command declines rather than going backwards. It sits at the step where
  somebody is following instructions exactly.

- **Mail arriving after a wake exited was refused as "still working".** The
  commoner ordering, and the last of this one: a wake runs, the woken agent
  reads its inbox, which is a call to Dibs and makes it recently in touch, the
  command exits with nothing having arrived meanwhile, and *then* a question
  lands. Nothing was running, so nothing was owed, so no turn end was recorded,
  and the recency test refused the wake on the strength of a turn that had
  already finished, without even arming a deferred re-check. The message was
  stored and reported delivered. The exit records the turn end unconditionally
  now, which is simply true and makes both orderings answer correctly, rather
  than adding a third branch for the third case.

  And the two facts the exit produces arrive together. Clearing "running"
  happened outside the writer loop while recording the turn end was queued onto
  it, and different branches read each: a message landing in between saw the
  agent as no longer running AND as recently in touch, so it was neither marked,
  nor woken, nor deferred. Both happen in one turn of the loop, which makes the
  intermediate state unobservable rather than merely unlikely. A window that
  narrow is not worth closing with a narrower one.

- **A retried wake said "question" from nobody.** The retry passed a hard-coded
  message type and a bare event, so `{type}` and `{from}` were wrong on every
  wake that went through a cooldown or an exit re-check, which this release
  makes the ordinary path rather than a corner: a request, a handoff or an
  approval all arrived at the operator's command as a question from an empty
  sender. Both are documented configuration. The retry reads the longest-waiting
  blocking message instead, and says `notice` when the reason is a blocking
  notice rather than mail, because that is not one of the four message types and
  should not borrow their vocabulary.

- **The source build produced a notifier the building Mac could not run.**
  Stating the release's target inside the bundler fixed the archive and broke
  the escape hatch the Intel drop documents: `task build` on an Intel Mac
  produced native Go binaries, a native presence helper, and an arm64-only
  `dibs-notify` beside them, which the runtime finds at the expected path and
  runs rather than falling back. The target is an input now. The release states
  one because it is building for somewhere else; a local build states none
  because it is building for the machine it is on.

- **The locked board told a Touch ID user to make an admin password.** Both the
  401 text and the page a browser gets said the way in is the password, at the
  exact moment somebody is locked out and looking for instructions. The README
  and the Homebrew caveat had the same error and were corrected a round earlier;
  nothing was watching this one, which is the version a person actually reads.

- **And the re-check could not get past the same test one hop later.**
  Recording the arrival before the recency short-circuit fixed the branch that
  decides whether a re-check is owed, and the re-check itself then asked
  `recentlyInTouch` and returned: the agent is recently in touch precisely
  because the wake it has just finished called Dibs. The wake command runs the
  agent's whole turn in that process, so the process exiting IS the turn
  finishing, which is what `turnEnded` already means and what a Stop hook would
  report on any other path. It is recorded at the exit, and every later
  re-check, including the deferred one, reads the right answer. The test stopped
  at "the exit owes a re-check" and never drove the decision, which is where
  production lost it.

- **A failed wake plus mail during it left a live timer.** Two re-checks can be
  owed at once, armed by different code: the failure arms one for its cooldown,
  the arrival arms one for the exit. The exit runs first and dropped the
  cooldown entry from the map without stopping the timer, so the orphan fired
  later and started a third command, against the promise two lines from it that
  a command failing twice fails rather than looping.

- **The one instruction the role pin has was invalid TOML for the names this
  release added.** The daemon prints the `[roles.identity]` line to paste,
  because the operator cannot look a fingerprint up anywhere else, and it
  interpolated the agent's name as a bare key. A bare TOML key holds only
  letters, digits, underscores and dashes, so `Fleet Lead = "..."` does not
  parse: following the daemon's own advice produced a `dibs.toml` it then
  refuses to load, with the role still ungranted and a new fault on top. The
  guard hands the printed snippet to the same decoder the daemon uses rather
  than checking that it looks quoted.

- **`task build` could not build on the Mac the release no longer covers.** The
  app bundle's icon renderer is a build-time tool that the build then executes,
  and it was compiled through the same helper as the shipped notifier, which now
  states an arm64 target: on an Intel Mac Swift emitted a binary the next line
  could not run. Building from source is the documented answer for anyone whose
  Mac the release dropped, so that path has to work. A tool that runs during the
  build and a file that ships in the archive have opposite requirements, and one
  function serving both is how they were confused.

- **Reading the inbox cancelled the re-check that exists for what comes after
  it.** Mail arriving during a running wake is re-asked when that command exits,
  and the woken agent's inbox read is itself a call to Dibs, so the agent became
  "recently in touch" and the short-circuit fired before anything recorded the
  arrival. The fix shipped one round earlier was therefore unreachable on
  precisely the ordering it was written for, and the test could not see it
  because it drove the decision directly and skipped that branch. The arrival is
  recorded before the recency test, and only where a wake is known to be
  running: an agent working at its own keyboard is still left alone.

- **The Swift helpers are built for a stated target**, not for whatever the
  release runner happened to be. `Dibs.app` is built once and copied into every
  archive, and with no `-target` it took the host's default: `dibs-notify` was
  arm64-only inside `darwin_amd64`, where the passive notification path returns
  the exec error rather than falling back to `osascript`, so the release's whole
  human-in-the-loop story was absent on a shipped target while every check was
  green. The archive check reads Mach-O headers now, across every darwin
  archive, because a file at the right path that cannot execute is not an
  installation.

- **A standing role declared by name was never granted.** `[roles]` is
  documented to take agent names, `register` turns a name into an id, and the
  reconciler passed the configured string straight to a lookup keyed by id: the
  documented `admin = ["Fleet Lead"]` waited forever for an agent whose id was
  literally that, while the agent that registered under the name sat there as
  `fleet-lead`. Every existing test used an already-slugged name, so the
  distinction never showed. Names resolve now, and a name held by two live
  agents is refused rather than resolved to whichever came first.

- **A configured certificate was checked against the config's address, and the
  daemon may not be listening there.** `-addr` and `DIBS_ADDR` both outrank
  `dibs.toml`, so a board with an explicit pair and no configured address passed
  `dibd -check` and config loading, served TLS on the default loopback listener,
  and was refused by every client on hostname verification. The check cannot
  live where the config is loaded, because that code cannot see the flag and
  assuming loopback there would refuse a certificate that is right for the
  address the daemon was told to bind, which `dibs upgrade` always passes: the
  refusal would land mid-cutover with the previous daemon already stopped. It is
  asked at startup, where the address is finally settled.

- **`dibs upgrade` could change the board's transport on a direct restart.**
  The daemon resolves `-addr`, then `DIBS_ADDR`, then the config, and upgrade
  passes `-addr`, which outranks the variable still set in the environment the
  replacement inherits. A board launched with `DIBS_ADDR=http://10.0.0.9:4777`
  whose `dibs.toml` does not repeat that address was therefore handed the bare
  form, and the replacement re-inferred TLS for a non-loopback host while every
  client went on speaking plaintext; the reverse turns an explicitly TLS
  loopback board into one nobody can reach. The environment is consulted with
  the same rule as the config, which is to state the scheme only where the
  source names the listener the daemon actually bound.

- **`SECURITY.md`'s summary table described an authorisation model two rounds
  out of date.** It put `/` and `/events` under "needs the admin password, never
  the secret alone", where a session cookie alone is sufficient by design
  (`EventSource` cannot send a header) and that session is minted by Touch ID on
  a Mac that has no admin password; the document's own detailed section had it
  right. It also still described a standing role as pinned to the first agent it
  landed on, which was replaced by the `[roles.identity]` fingerprint
  requirement in this same release, and said the launch claim is suppressed
  whenever `[roles] coordinator` names somebody, where a bare name decides
  nothing precisely because it can never be granted. A security document that
  contradicts the code is worse than none, and these were contract errors rather
  than wording.

- **Mail arriving during a wake was discarded.** A wake command is bounded at
  two hours and reads its inbox near the start of that turn, and the branch that
  refuses a second command while one is running threw the later event away on
  the reading that the running activation would see it. Anything arriving after
  that inbox read therefore waited for an unrelated event that might never come:
  a question could sit unanswered for a day with the board reporting it
  delivered. It is re-asked when the command exits, which is the one moment that
  neither starts a process beside a live one nor loops, and the re-ask asks
  whether anybody is still waiting, so an activation that answered its mail
  produces nothing.

- **The MCP Registry could publish a version the release gate refused.** The
  registry workflow listened for the same tag push as the release and waited for
  nothing, so it could authenticate and publish while the gate was still
  running, or after it had failed and produced no release at all. The comment
  claiming the two "cannot drift from each other" described a correlation as an
  ordering. It is a reusable workflow called from the release behind `needs:`
  now, so the ordering is GitHub's to enforce, and there is still one copy of
  the publish steps.

- **A purged agent's outbound mail became the next agent's.** The sweep
  deliberately keeps what a purged agent SENT, because that inbox belongs to
  whoever received it, and the id is derived from the name and goes straight
  back into use. So the envelopes went on naming an address the next registrant
  was handed: it appeared to have written mail it never sent, and because a
  response routes by sender, answering the purged agent's question delivered the
  answer to a stranger and told the responder it was delivered. The check that
  reports an answer with nowhere to go was the path being defeated, because a
  live replacement makes the sender look present. Those senders are retired to
  an address outside the alphabet ids are minted from, so no name can ever be
  turned into one.

- **`go install` gives macOS two of the four artifacts**, and said nothing about
  it. The Touch ID helper is Swift and the notifier is an app bundle, so neither
  can come from `go install`: the board falls back to the admin password and
  notifications lose their name and their buttons, with nothing to suggest the
  installation was partial. The section says so, and points at the two paths
  that carry everything.

- **The onboarding sent macOS operators to create the credential this release
  replaced.** `dibs web` raises the daemon-owned Touch ID sheet first and asks
  for an admin password only where there is no sensor, and the README called the
  password "a prerequisite for `dibs web`, not optional hardening". So did the
  Homebrew caveat every macOS installer reads, and the Claude Code plugin's
  prerequisites, in both the repository copy and the embedded one that actually
  ships. The tutorial had it right, which is the wording the rest now follow.

- **The wake documentation described two mechanisms as one.** Inside the
  `[wake.exec]` section, one paragraph said only a question, request or handoff
  wakes anything and only for an agent "not already active", and five lines
  later the `all` and `urgent` values of `extend_turn_for` were explained as
  though they were the same setting. They are not: `[wake.exec]` starts a
  stopped process, `extend_turn_for` decides what a running one is told at its
  next turn boundary and can start nothing. The wake test is also not `active`,
  which means only that the forty-five minute idle lease has not lapsed: an
  agent whose turn ended seconds ago is `active` and is not running, and waking
  it is the case the code deliberately handles. Both halves say what the code
  does, and `extend_turn_for` has its own heading.

- **`dibd -check` answered a question it was not asked.** It says it reports
  whether this build could take over, and `dibs upgrade` reads a zero exit as
  licence to stop the running daemon. It returned before the effective listen
  address was resolved and before any certificate was looked at, so it proved
  replay and nothing else: a malformed `-addr`, a malformed `DIBS_ADDR`, a
  configured pair that will not load, or a damaged signing identity all passed,
  and the fleet then went down at a bind or a `ServeTLS` nobody had asked about,
  with recovery retrying the same replacement rather than the previous build, so
  it stayed down. It resolves the address through the same function startup
  uses and asks whether the transport is usable without creating anything.
  `dibs upgrade` also passed only `-dir` while starting the replacement with
  `-addr`, so the proof and the thing proved were about different daemons.

  The preflight's first form re-derived startup's transport tree instead of
  asking for it, and had already drifted in two places: `http://` with a
  configured certificate is a contradiction startup refuses and this passed, and
  `https://` with `insecure_plaintext` took the plaintext branch here while
  startup honours the stated scheme. It calls `transport.Resolve` now, with a
  generation callback that refuses, which turns the real decision into a
  side-effect-free question. A copy of a decision is a decision that will drift.

- **A failed wake spent the only attempt and reported success.** The cooldown is
  taken before the process starts, which is right, but keeping it after the
  command *failed* spent the single attempt that message was ever going to get
  on a process that woke nobody, while `send` still reported the mailbox
  written. It is released when the command did not run, and one re-check is
  armed so the failure does not simply end there.

- **Mail arriving inside a cooldown was dropped rather than deferred.**
  `maybeWake` fires once per event and nothing retried, so a question arriving
  after a wake had exited but inside its ninety seconds was refused and then
  forgotten, and the recipient stayed asleep until some unrelated event happened
  to arrive. Ninety seconds is a rate limit on starting processes and was
  behaving as one on delivering mail. A timer re-asks when the window expires.

- **Two wakes could resume one thread at once.** The cooldown is a start-time
  rule and the command runs for up to two hours, so ninety seconds later another
  blocking event launched a second `codex exec resume` beside the first and one
  thread got two activations interleaving into a single transcript: the
  duplicate-process failure the cooldown exists to prevent, arriving through the
  gap between "recently started" and "still going". A wake that is still running
  excludes another outright. Releasing a *failed* wake's cooldown also deleted
  unconditionally, so an earlier failure could erase a newer attempt's window; a
  failure releases only its own generation.

- **A leaked descriptor made an agent permanently unreachable.** Bounding the
  wake command's output made stdout and stderr a non-file writer, which `os/exec`
  copies through a pipe, and killing the process at the deadline does not close
  a descriptor a *grandchild* inherited: `Wait` blocked on an EOF that never
  arrived, past the two-hour bound, indefinitely. The bookkeeping that marks a
  wake finished runs on defer, so the agent stayed marked as still going and
  every later message to it was refused as a duplicate. `cmd.WaitDelay` bounds
  it. Neither change was wrong alone.

- **A blocking notice could be evicted by situational ones.** The `Blocking`
  flag exists so an approval reaches an agent that stopped waiting for it, and
  the list below it kept the newest sixteen regardless of kind; the loss is
  unrecoverable by any other path, because the request is terminal and is not
  pending mail anywhere. Situational notices are sacrificed first. The trim also
  rebuilt its result by matching `(serial, text)`, which is not an identity:
  supervisor notices use serial zero deliberately, so seventeen identical
  entries each matched one of the sixteen selected and all seventeen came back,
  growing again on every push. It keeps by position now.

- **The presence prompt could be approved for a request the operator never
  saw.** Two outstanding checks meant the operator opens the board, an agent
  asks in the same moment, one sheet is approved, and which request receives the
  credential is a race the person cannot see, and they approved exactly the
  prompt they expected. Serialised now, and at the prompt rather than in the board's
  handler, because `human_unlock` over MCP calls the same check directly. The
  409 first said an approval "cannot be taken by a request it was not raised
  for", which is false and backwards; the sheet carries a four-letter code that
  `dibs web` prints, so a prompt showing a different code was raised by
  something else. And contention was reported to the agent as the human
  *declining*, which told it to ask them to press a button that is not there.

- **The board dropped its trailing update.** `refreshMail` returned when a fetch
  was outstanding, so an event arriving mid-flight lost its refresh and the
  in-flight response painted the mailbox as it was *before* that event, with
  nothing to correct it: an approval stayed invisible for thirty seconds, or
  until reload if the pending fetch hung. One trailing refresh is kept, which is
  the difference between fewer requests and a wrong screen.

- **A data race on the footprint cache.** `agentsNeedingFootprints` read the map
  bare inside the writer loop while the backfill wrote it under `matchMu` from a
  goroutine that runs *off* the loop precisely so a slow scorer cannot stall
  coordination. On a Go map the runtime turns that into a crash rather than a
  wrong answer. The single writer is a guarantee about state, not about every
  map an engine holds.

- **A month dormant cost an agent its standing role, permanently.** Archival
  blanks the nonce and keeps the nonce *index*, which is what lets recovery find
  the row at all; reattaching restored the token, the session and the mailbox
  and left the nonce empty, so the agent's identity resolved to nothing and a
  role declared in `dibs.toml` could never reconcile onto it again. It came back
  as itself, with its mail and its claims, and without the role the operator's
  config grants it.

- **The ambient session repair told twenty callers they had adopted one
  mailbox.** The check and the bind were separate trips through the writer loop,
  so concurrent callers all saw an empty session id and all bound; the id that
  stuck was whichever finished last, and every other holder went on believing it
  would receive that agent's mail. That is the failure the repair exists to
  prevent, caused by the repair.

- **A configured certificate was checked for pairing, and not for time or for
  this board.** Loading proves the key belongs to the certificate, not that
  anybody will accept it: an expired one serves perfectly and every client
  refuses, and a certificate issued for another host does the same, so `dibd
  -check` blessed a board nobody could reach. Both are checked where the config
  is loaded, so `dibd -check` and `dibs mcp-config` see the same answer.

- **An empty bootstrap token printed an unusable link and exited zero.** Any 200
  that decoded was accepted, so a truncated response produced `/?bt=` and a
  success: the operator opens a link that unlocks nothing and has no idea why.

- **`DIBS_DIR` went into harness config verbatim.** That file outlives the shell
  that produced it, so a relative path resolves against wherever the bridge is
  later launched from, and the same line means a different board or none. The
  credential directory is the one value there that must not be re-interpreted
  somewhere else.

- **A space that could not be opened was reported as an empty field.** The
  opener returns nothing on a limit, on exhausted retries, and on a success
  carrying no id, and the caller answered "nothing was close, so one was opened
  for this work and the next agent joins you here". Two of those three things
  were false: the agent is told it has the field to itself while having nowhere
  for anybody to find it. It is its own outcome now, and the hint says to open
  one.

- **`--adopt-dir` recovery started a unit pointing at the directory it had just
  moved.** When the unit rewrite fails, recovery runs with the correct new
  directory in hand and started the unit anyway: a daemon against a path that
  no longer exists, printed as a recovery. The unit is preferred when it
  describes this board and not when it does not. Reading that out of the file
  was then wrong twice in its first hour: paths in a launchd plist are
  XML-escaped, so a board under `Fleet &amp; Review` was read as another one,
  and a substring test accepted `~/.dibs-old` as naming `~/.dibs`. Tokens are
  taken whole and compared as cleaned paths. An unreadable unit is still
  trusted, because refusing over a permissions problem downgrades a supervised
  service to an orphan process.

- **Three shell scripts had entered the tree through YAML**, and an unpinned
  tool sat in the job that holds `id-token: write`. The no-shell rule is about
  what shell *is*, not where the bytes live: a `run: |` block is a shell script
  that happens to live in a workflow, and it cannot be built, vetted or run
  locally. All three are Go programs under `tools/` now, and the guard reads
  `run:` blocks for shell logic rather than for file extensions. It immediately
  found two more, one of them `${{ inputs.version }}` interpolated straight into
  a run line, which is GitHub's own documented script-injection shape. The
  publish job pinned its action to a SHA and left the tool version unset, so it
  downloaded whatever `latest` meant that morning, which is the same shape the
  file refuses three lines lower, in a comment, in the step that quotes it.

- **The release configuration was invalid and nothing checked it.** Shipping the
  notifier bundle in the cask was written as a field GoReleaser has no such key
  for, so `goreleaser check` rejected the file outright and the tag would have
  stopped before building anything, while `task ci` passed: the gate validated
  every other surface and not the one where a failure means the release did not
  happen. `goreleaser check` is in the gate now, watched failing against the
  form that was written.

- **`[wake.exec]` accepted entries that could never wake anybody.** `argv = [" ",
  …]` is a valid TOML string and a useless program name: it passed `dibd
  -check`, startup logged that the board can start an agent that is not running,
  and every wake failed inside `exec` before starting anything. Same for a blank
  harness key, which matches nothing that will ever register while still
  counting as configured, and for two keys differing only in case, which
  collapsed onto one entry with map iteration deciding which executable
  survived.

- **The coordinator briefing denied a capability in its own sentence.** It
  listed `adopt_agent` and then said "you still cannot read another agent's
  mail". Adoption moves a dormant mailbox onto a live agent and the point is to
  read it; `dibs://staff` and the role documentation both state the exception,
  and the briefing carried on the grant event, which is the first thing a newly
  promoted agent is guaranteed to read, denied it. It separates "no `all_mail` for a
  live peer" from the real exception, and says to adopt only what is genuinely
  abandoned. `CONFIGURATION.md` also said `{thread}` takes the *first* resumable
  alias, where the implementation deliberately takes the newest, because the
  first is a thread the agent left: a document that would have argued a future
  reader back into a fixed bug.

- **The nudge that tells an agent it has mail never changed, so it stopped
  being read.** The `waiting` line rides on every authenticated write, which
  makes it the most reliable delivery path here: no hook, no plugin, no session
  id, and it cannot be misrouted. It fired correctly on roughly forty
  consecutive tool calls of one session with a message unread throughout, and
  was deferred every time; the operator found the mail. It said the same eleven
  words on the fortieth call as on the first, so within a few turns there was
  nothing in it for the eye to catch on. `pendingMail` had already diagnosed
  exactly this in its own comment and left the line unchanged, which is how the
  surface that reports the problem came to have it. Both that line and the hook
  digest now carry the AGE of what is waiting: a fact worth triaging on, since
  five minutes and five hours deserve different answers, and different text on
  every call, so there is no fixed shape to learn. Silent under five minutes,
  because spending the novelty on mail that arrived a moment ago is how it went
  blind in the first place. Still counts and ages only: no bodies.

- **`adopt_agent`'s result read as a standing redirect, and it is not one.** It
  said "the source agent still exists and keeps its history: only where its mail
  is delivered has changed", which is true of the messages it moved and reads as
  a rule. A coordinator that adopted three mailboxes concluded it had become the
  delivery address for that NAME and would hand the address back if the original
  returned, and reported that to the operator. Adoption re-addresses the
  messages that exist at that instant and creates no alias and no forwarding
  entry; mail sent afterwards reaches whoever it is addressed to, including the
  source the moment it comes back. The difference is the whole safety of the
  operation, since a standing redirect would be a coordinator-approvable
  interception of a live agent's mail. The note now says what it does, and a
  test sends to the source after an adoption to keep it that way.

- **`SKILLS.md` told agents to run `dibs await` and omitted the flag that
  decides whether it works.** `-timeout` defaults to **30 minutes** and then
  exits 1, so an agent following the example verbatim gets a watcher that gives
  up half an hour in while the agent believes it is covered for the session, and
  a dead watcher is indistinguishable from a waiting one. `-since` was missing
  too, so the default of "from now" silently skipped anything that arrived
  before the call. Both are in the example now, with what exit 1 means and a
  note not to reach for `timeout(1)`, which does not exist on macOS and dies
  instantly at 127 while reporting as armed. Reported by an agent that hit both.

- **Every repository-hygiene guard was blind to files nobody had committed
  yet.** The walk all of those checks are built on listed TRACKED files, so a
  file that had not been `git add`ed was the one file none of them read. That is
  exactly backwards: a brand new file is the one most likely to break a
  convention, because nothing about it has ever been reviewed. The way it goes
  wrong is quiet and it completes: write the file, run `task ci`, watch it pass
  having opened none of it, commit, and the guard first fires on the NEXT run,
  against code that has already shipped. Found by doing precisely that, two em
  dashes in a new test file went through a green gate and were reported by the
  following one, one commit too late to be prevention. The walk now passes
  `--cached --others --exclude-standard`, so untracked files are read and
  `.gitignore` still keeps build output out. The regression test is written
  against the WALK rather than against em dashes, because the hole belonged to
  every rule in the package equally and that one rule was only what happened to
  notice it.

- **`dibs upgrade` stopped the daemon for a rewrite it already knew would be
  refused, then restarted the OLD binary and called it the new one.** The
  rewrite is refused for two independent reasons: the file cannot be written,
  which preflight checked, and a unit under one of the pre-`org.agenxy.dibs`
  labels is still installed, which it did not. Preflight exists so that nothing
  is stopped for a failure that was knowable in advance, and this one was
  knowable the whole time. What followed is the worse half: recovery restarts
  through the unit it could not rewrite, that unit still names this board so it
  is preferred, its `ExecStart` still pins the previous build, and the operator
  is told "the daemon was started again ... This is the NEW build, not a
  rollback". So the upgrade did not happen, the old daemon is serving, and the
  command said otherwise. Migrating exactly such an installation is ordinary
  use. Preflight now asks the same question the real write asks, with the same
  override set, so the refusal arrives while the board is still up.

- **The waiting nudge aged the mail and nothing else.** The line reports unread
  messages, unacknowledged announcements and updates to you, and the age added
  above was taken from the inbox alone. With no unread mail it therefore went
  back to printing identical bytes on every call, which is the habituation it
  was changed to cure, still alive on two of the three things it reports: an
  agent sitting on an announcement for six hours read the same sentence it read
  six hours ago. The previous entry claimed both surfaces carry the age of what
  is waiting, and the code carried the age of one source in three. It now takes
  the oldest of whichever kinds are actually waiting. Announcements already
  recorded when they were made; notices recorded no time at all and now carry
  the time of the event that caused them, rather than the time they were
  queued, so that rebuilding the cache after a restart does not report old news
  as fresh.

- **Approving a mailbox request still described a one-time move as a standing
  redirect.** A mailbox moves by two routes, `adopt_agent` and approving a
  `request` that carries `adopt`, and the fix above reached one of them. The
  approval route is the one a stranded agent is actually pointed at, since the
  hint on a taken name says to ask a coordinator, and it went on returning
  "only where its mail is delivered has changed": the exact wording that led a
  coordinator to announce itself as the delivery address for somebody else's
  name. Both routes now return one shared sentence, because two hand-written
  copies of a sentence are two chances to be wrong about it.

- **`SECURITY.md` promised that only one presence prompt waits at a time, and
  the lock behind that sentence is per process.** `promptBusy` is a mutex inside
  one `dibd`, and `dibd -allow-parallel` is a supported way to run several on
  one Mac, so two boards can each have a Touch ID check outstanding and the
  serialisation does not reach between them. The comment on the lock argued the
  right premise and drew the wrong conclusion from it, that a screen is package
  level when a screen is machine level. The document now says "per daemon" and
  names the gap, and the code comment says what the lock actually covers. The
  control that does hold across daemons is the one the same section already
  rests on: `dibs web` prints a four-letter code and a sheet showing a different
  one is not yours. Whether two sheets can be on screen at once is a question
  about macOS that has not been measured here, and saying Dibs provides the
  machine-wide guarantee when it does not is the part that was wrong either way.
  Found by the pre-release review.

  And the sentence that recommends the affected deployment said the opposite.
  "If you run agents you do not trust, do not point them at the same daemon. Run
  a second `dibd` with its own data directory; **they share nothing**." They
  share no coordination state, which is what that sentence was about, and they
  share the screen, which is the one channel that asks a human to authorise
  something. So the configuration `SECURITY.md` recommends for isolating agents
  you do not trust is exactly the configuration in which its own
  one-prompt-at-a-time guarantee stops holding, and the two sentences are eight
  lines apart. Both now say so and point at each other.

- **And the nudge that reports all of this walked the mailbox twice.** Splitting
  the age out into its own helper left it calling `Inbox` a second time, which
  scans every message on the board and sorts them. That line rides on every
  authenticated write, which is the whole reason it is the most reliable
  delivery path here, and it is therefore the last place to do the same
  expensive walk twice to re-derive something the first one already had. One
  pass now returns both the count and the oldest. Caught reviewing the fix that
  introduced it, before it was ever tagged.

### Security

- **An agent could claim another agent's thread and have the board wake it.**
  `register` and `bind_session` both take a caller-supplied `session_id`, and it
  was written down without a question being asked about it. Downstream, the wake
  path turns a UUID-shaped session id into the thread argument of the operator's
  own `[wake.exec]` command. So an agent that knew a peer's thread id could
  assert it, and the board would resume THAT thread on its behalf, while hook
  resolution for the peer went ambiguous at the same time. No mail body was
  exposed; what crossed the boundary was whose thread the operator's command
  starts. Reported by the pre-release review, which reproduced it.

  **Thread-shaped ids only, and the narrowness is the design.** Session ids are
  deliberately shared in the ordinary case: the stdio bridge derives
  `host-<ppid>` from the harness process, so every agent registering through one
  bridge presents the same id on purpose. The obvious reading of this defect,
  that session ids must be unique, would have refused the second agent in every
  harness on the machine. The test applied is the same one the wake path applies
  before treating an id as a thread to resume, so there is one answer to the
  question rather than two. Rebinding your own id, reattaching with your own
  NONCE, and taking an id from a closed or archived agent all still work.

  The check is the nonce and not the name, and the first version got that
  wrong. It stood aside whenever the supplied name matched the holder's, on the
  theory that this was a row reattaching to itself before it had a token. A name
  is public. So the victim's name plus a fresh nonce of your own walked through
  the guard, the fold took neither reattachment branch, and it minted a SIBLING
  holding the victim's thread: two live agents on one thread, which is the thing
  the guard exists to prevent, let through by the guard. The regression test
  missed it because its attacker used a different name. Caught by the next
  review round.

  Refused at the ingress and not in the fold, because `Ledger.Replay` calls
  `Apply` directly: a refusal there would reject bindings that were legal when
  they were written and the daemon would decline to start on its own history.
  There is a test that folds exactly such a binding to keep it that way.

### Added

- **An agent could register under an id its own hooks never quote, so nothing
  could wake it.** The stdio bridge fills `session_id` on registration from the
  harness's own sidecar, and it read that sidecar only when the MCP handshake
  had already identified the client as Claude Code. `clientIs` answers from the
  `clientInfo` an `initialize` left behind, and the 2026 path need not send one
  at all. When it had not been seen, the sidecar went unread and the agent
  registered under the bridge's `host-<ppid>` instead: an id no lifecycle hook
  ever quotes. `hook_poll` then resolved that agent to nobody, and no message
  ever woke it.

  It could not heal, which is what made it permanent rather than intermittent.
  The ambient repair binds the correct id, which the bridge already sends in
  `_meta` on every call, but only when the agent has NO session id. The primary
  was already filled with the wrong one, so the repair was a no-op for the life
  of the board. Measured on this project's own board: an agent registered as
  `host-5360` while both its sidecar and its hooks named the same UUID, and for
  hours its mail was announced into a different agent's session instead.

  **The sidecar is now trusted when the harness is this bridge's own parent**,
  handshake or not. `CLAUDE_PID` alone is not enough and dropping the gate
  outright was tried and reverted: that variable is INHERITED by every process a
  Claude Code session spawns, so an ungated read lets an unrelated nested bridge
  adopt its parent's session and answer to its wake path. The guard end-to-end
  suite caught that immediately, with test daemons registering under the
  developer's own session. A harness spawns its bridge as a DIRECT child, which
  is the same fact the `host-<ppid>` fallback already relies on, so
  `CLAUDE_PID` matching this process's parent is positive evidence the session
  is ours rather than one we inherited. Nested processes fail that test, and the
  fallback is unchanged for harnesses that write no sidecar at all.

- **`update` can give up a session binding that is not yours.** Recording
  whether a binding was stated or guessed stops new ones going astray and can do
  nothing for the ones already on disk, which decode as stated on purpose. So a
  board that already has one was stuck: the wrong agent is woken, the mailbox's
  owner is refused its own id with `E_SESSION_TAKEN`, the holder has no reason
  to notice it is holding one, and a daemon restart replays it faithfully.
  Measured here, across exactly that restart. `update` takes `release_session`
  now, which drops the caller's own primary and aliases so the session they
  belong to can claim them back. Only ever the caller's own, which is what makes
  it safe with no role attached: an agent giving up its own bindings can strand
  nothing but itself, and it is the one participant that can always tell whether
  an id is really its session. That is the second tool-listing budget raise in
  one night, argued for in the commit that made it, as that guard's own rule
  asks.

- **A mis-bound session id can now find its way home.** Preventing new bad
  bindings did nothing for the ones already on disk, and the guard that refuses
  a held id refused the rightful session too, so the state was permanent: the
  agent that owns the mailbox never received a wake, the agent that inherited
  the id had no reason to notice it was holding one, and restarting the daemon
  replayed it faithfully. Bindings now record whether they were STATED by the
  caller or GUESSED by the daemon from the working directory, and a stated claim
  takes an id back from a guess while taking nothing from an agent that stated
  its own. Historical ops carry no such field, decode as stated, and are
  therefore left alone: the conservative direction on purpose, since treating
  them as guesses would make every agent on an upgraded board reclaimable by
  whoever states its id first.

  Provenance is recorded against each BINDING rather than each agent, which is
  the difference between a repair and a hole: an agent holds a primary and any
  number of aliases, so one flag per agent meant whichever binding happened last
  decided the answer for all of them, and a single guessed alias would have made
  a STATED primary claimable by anyone.

  Resolution prefers a stated holder too, which fixes a second thing. Two agents
  could hold one id, and the lookup returned whichever Go's map iteration
  reached first, so the same hook could resolve to a different agent on
  consecutive turns. That is settled by preference rather than by deleting the
  loser's binding, because a delete belongs in the fold and would be
  retroactive.

- **A sweep could delete mail without writing it down, so a restart brought it
  back.** Mail outlives its recipient by design: a sweep written before v0.0.7
  removes the agent row and leaves the messages. Retention evicts those later
  with no row to attribute them to, and the eviction reported a change only
  through an event it could not emit without one. So the sweep returned
  `changed: false`, the engine ledgers exactly when the serial advanced and
  therefore wrote nothing, and the next restart replayed a board where the
  messages still existed: deleted in memory, alive on disk, back after a bounce.
  `state == fold(ledger)` failing with nothing logged and nothing erroring. The
  flag that records a mutation emitting no event already existed and the other
  two deletion sites already set it; this one did not.

- **`bind_session` checked a size limit inside the fold.** `Admit` already
  rejects an oversized session id at ingress, and `Apply` repeated it, which
  makes replay conditional on today's configuration: lower the limit in a later
  release and the daemon refuses ops it accepted, fsynced and acknowledged under
  the old one, and will not boot on its own ledger. The same shape as the
  announcement bound that `TestApplyFoldsWhateverAdmitRejects` was written for;
  its list simply did not know this op existed, which is the weakness that test's
  own comment admits to. The op is in the list now.

- **Two v0.0.7 repairs now say which version wrote them.** Both changed what an
  EXISTING op does: a register began raising a new agent's watermark past mail
  its vanished predecessor left, and a prune stopped re-closing an already-closed
  agent or advancing the serial for a no-op. Right for ops written from here on,
  and applied to an older ledger they reconstruct a board that never existed: a
  different inbox, and an `agent.closed` the original fold really did emit
  silently dropped, with the serial difference repaired by the path that exists
  for corruption. Ops now record the semantics they were written under, the same
  treatment `purge_mail` and `restore_nonce` already had.

- **A wake into a session that reports a different working directory is now
  refused rather than logged.** Delivering it interrupts a session that is not
  the recipient, leaves the intended agent asleep, and reports success, which
  spends the only attempt the retry machinery would have given it: three
  failures at once, the third being the "success with no effect" defect this
  release keeps finding. Both directories are canonicalised before comparing,
  because the agent's is canonical at registration and the harness writes its
  own raw, and on macOS that difference alone refused a correct delivery.

- **A new agent no longer inherits the previous occupant's mail.** An id is
  derived from the name, so a name that comes back reuses the id, and mail
  outlives the row it was addressed to: a sweep written before v0.0.7 removes
  the row and keeps the messages, which its op records and replay must preserve.
  Those messages are expired with a reason the SENDER reads, so deleting them
  would trade one silent loss for another. What was wrong is that they were
  still delivered: measured, a new agent registering the same name was shown the
  previous occupant's question verbatim, body included. It now starts with a
  watermark past them, and `read_mail` refuses a serial older than the agent
  itself.

  **Not listing it was not protecting it.** The watermark was enforced only when
  enumerating an inbox, so a replacement could not SEE that mail and could still
  fetch the body by serial. And the watermark is built from mail addressed TO
  the id, so it never covered what the predecessor SENT: `read_mail` matched on
  the reused id and handed over the other half of somebody else's conversation.
  The rule is "older than this agent" now, which covers both directions, reads
  as no filtering for rows registered before the field existed, and leaves a
  reattaching agent its own history, because a reattach is the same agent.

  **That watermark had never filtered anything.** It was set by the retention
  sweep and reported to callers, and nothing consulted it, which went unnoticed
  because the sweep that sets it has already deleted the mail it covers: there
  was nothing left to filter, so an inert watermark and a working one looked
  identical. They stop looking identical the moment mail outlives its row.

- **A prune no longer writes down that it did nothing.** An empty prune built no
  targets and advanced the serial anyway, so the engine appended an op recording
  that nothing happened, on demand, forever. And pruning an agent that was
  already closed closed it again, emitting a second `agent.closed` for a
  transition that happened once, on BOTH prune paths, the agent's own and the
  administrator's: the audit stream is what `dibs log` and every
  `events_since` consumer reads, and an invented transition is worse there than
  a missing one because it is indistinguishable from a real one.

- **The registry check accepted things that are not versions.** An explicit
  value went positionally to `gh release view`, and anything starting with a
  dash is not positional: `--help` was read as an option, exited zero, and the
  release-existence check took that as proof the release was there. It is
  checked against a semantic-version shape first now.

- **The no-shell rule now covers the Taskfile.** The guard read `run:` blocks in
  `.github/workflows` and nothing else, so `review:release` was a multiline
  shell program with conditionals and redirection for its whole life, while the
  changelog claimed the class was removed and guarded. It is a Go program under
  `tools/`, and the guard reads every command form (from round eleven; until
  then it read `cmd:` mappings alone). The predicate is shared
  rather than copied, and it ignores template actions and quoted arguments,
  because a guard that calls `echo "asked for Desktop access"` a loop is one
  that gets deleted.

- **The Homebrew cask no longer promises what it does not check.** It says it
  clears the macOS quarantine flag, and ran `xattr` without treating failure as
  fatal, so a real failure left the install green and the flag in place. Making
  it fatal would be worse, since `xattr` exits non-zero in ordinary cases, so
  the claim now matches the behaviour and both the cask and the README say what
  to run if macOS still refuses.

- **A wake that lands in a session working somewhere else now says so.** The
  socket route delivers wherever the binding points, and a binding can be wrong:
  a swept row frees a live session's id and the next agent registering in that
  directory inherits it. Before this route existed that misdelivery was
  invisible, because the wake simply failed; now it succeeds, into the wrong
  session, which is more effective and no more correct. The harness records each
  session's working directory, so a wake into an unrelated one is logged.
  Reported, never refused: the daemon cannot tell which of the two is wrong, and
  a heuristic refusal would ground legitimate wakes for agents that moved.

- **An unreadable daemon registry no longer reads as "no daemon".** `upgrade`
  turned every registry-read failure into an empty result, so an unreadable
  registry meant "nothing is running": the stop was skipped, the replacement
  exited at once on the directory lock the original still holds, the original
  went on answering, and verification printed `upgraded:` for the process the
  command exists to replace. `LiveDaemons` says so in its own comment, that an
  error is not an absence and conflating them is how a guard fails open, and the
  caller conflated them anyway. Unknown now counts as running: stopping a daemon
  that was not there costs a no-op, and the other way costs a silent non-upgrade.

- **The hygiene walk counted files it had not opened.** It counted every
  callback it invoked and called that "what was actually opened", while most
  checks return silently when the read fails: an unreadable file counted toward
  the floor that proves the walk looked at something, with no check having
  examined a byte of it. The walk reads each file itself now and fails on one it
  cannot, which is the state a bad merge leaves and exactly what should not pass
  quietly.

- **A certificate that is not a CA could become the board's signing identity.**
  The check asked only whether the certificate and key matched and whether it
  had expired, which a restored or misnamed SERVER certificate satisfies: `dibd
  -check` then called the board healthy, the daemon signed leaves with it, and
  every client rejected the chain. The basic constraints, the certificate-signing
  key usage and `NotBefore` are checked now, each with its own message, because
  a wrong clock and a restored leaf need opposite responses.

- **Twelve ledger op kinds were not frozen**, including `respond`, `ack`,
  `bind_session`, `prune_own`, `claim_coordinator`, `vouch_child` and four space
  operations. The table calls itself the authoritative list of ledger
  vocabulary, so renaming any of them left the guard green while every ledger
  containing that string stopped replaying: the check against silent data loss,
  silently not checking. They are frozen, and a new test reads the SOURCE and
  fails when a kind is declared without being frozen, because a list somebody
  must remember is exactly as good as the memory, which this repository has now
  said about itself three times.

- **A dangling symlink could silently rotate the board's signing identity.**
  `os.Stat` follows links, so a link whose target is gone reads as absent. With
  one dangling half and one truly missing file, both looked absent, the daemon
  found nothing to refuse and generated a NEW identity: every machine that ran
  `dibs trust` locked out, by a daemon that then reported itself healthy. The
  startup preflight already documents this hazard at length and calls `Lstat`;
  the lesson had been applied in one of the two places that need it, and the
  dangling-symlink test drives that one and never reaches this one, so it stayed
  green while startup behaved differently.

- **`dibs fingerprint` could describe a certificate no daemon can serve.** It
  discarded the error from loading `dibs.toml`, so an unparseable config fell
  back to the managed path and fingerprinted whatever stale certificate was
  there, while `dibd` refuses to start on that same file. On the one command
  whose purpose is comparing what is SERVED against what another machine pinned,
  and it exited zero. An absent config is still fine; a broken one now says so.

- **The registry could publish a version that was never released.** The manual
  recovery dispatch passed an operator-supplied version straight through, so
  `-version 9.9.9` stamped and published 9.9.9 for something never built, tagged
  or released. The release job's `needs:` closes that on the normal path and
  this walked around it, while the changelog claimed the hole was shut. An
  explicit version is now checked against a real GitHub release. The registry is
  public and permanent, so advertising an install nobody can complete is worse
  than a failed job.

- **Two guards had stopped guarding.** The tool-count gate skipped any document
  it could not read, backed only by a global "did we check anything at all", so
  one renamed file dropped out of coverage permanently and silently while the
  test stayed green. It now names them and fails. And the busy-presence
  regression test exercised only the status mapping, never the handler, so
  changing the handler to answer 500 kept it passing; the handler's use of that
  mapping is asserted now.

- **The Homebrew description still called Dibs single-machine**, which this
  release stopped being.

- **Finding sockets no longer happens on the writer loop.** The wake gate read a
  cache, and the lookup it used refreshed that cache when it expired: a
  directory scan and a bounded `ps` per candidate, inline, while the single
  writer was held, so every other agent's `declare`, `send` and `check_in`
  waited behind it. With a five-second cache and a thirty-second background
  refresh, most wake decisions did it. The gate now reads a snapshot and never
  refreshes; only the wake goroutine, which is off the loop, may. The liveness
  probe is bounded too, so a wedged filesystem costs a pause rather than a hang.

- **The first socket wake after a restart could be lost outright.** Priming ran
  in a goroutine while the daemon began serving, so an event arriving first was
  refused before any cooldown or retry state existed, and a later prime only
  fills the cache: nothing reconsiders mail that was already waiting. Priming is
  synchronous now, before the loop serves anything, which is affordable because
  every probe behind it is bounded.

- **Confirming a session id you already hold now counts as stating it.** The
  provenance update sat behind an early return taken when there is nothing NEW
  to bind, which is exactly what happens when a session names an id it already
  carries. So an agent that explicitly confirmed its own session stayed marked
  as having merely inherited it, and remained reclaimable by any other
  authenticated agent.

- **An agent can be woken over the socket its own harness publishes, with no
  configuration at all.** Claude Code publishes a unix socket and an
  authentication key per session; Dibs reads both and delivers the same notice
  `[wake.exec]` would have carried. A command has to be told which thread to
  resume, so Dibs had to work out which id an agent answers to, and every wake
  defect this cycle is downstream of getting that wrong. A socket is the
  address. It needs no operator config, spawns no process, and needs no thread
  id, which was the largest class of unwakeable agent on this machine. Verified
  against a live session rather than inferred: a message was sent over the path
  and watched arrive, and a wrong token produced nothing, which is how the auth
  is known to be enforced.

  Unchanged, deliberately: one gate in front of both routes, so the cooldown,
  the still-running flag and the deferral are shared rather than re-bought; no
  command and no socket is still no wake; and no process is ever spawned for a
  thread that cannot be resumed.

  **The notice is one sentence and points rather than instructs.** It said
  "Dibs: check the board. Call check_in, then inbox, and act on anything there",
  which names two tools in order and says what to do with what they return: that
  is deciding what the agent does next, which is the one thing the wake path is
  forbidden to do. It is "Dibs: check the board." now, on both routes, and the
  test asserts what must NOT be in it, because the way this goes wrong is
  somebody appending one more helpful clause. An earlier draft of this entry
  said the notice carries counts and senders; it carries neither, and never
  did.

- **A caller that says which session it is running in is now believed, instead
  of guessed at.** With no session alias on a call, the engine INFERS one by
  directory: it takes an id announced from that cwd recently and assumes the
  agent registering now is that session. It skips ids an agent already holds,
  which is not the same as ids still in USE. So when an agent is swept while its
  session keeps running, the id it held becomes unheld and stays live, and the
  next agent to register in that directory inherits a live session's id along
  with its wake stream. Measured on this project's own board: an ephemeral row
  was swept, the session behind it kept announcing, and the next agent resolved
  that session's hooks to itself, so one agent's unread list was rendered into
  another's context for hours and three agents spent a night deriving why.

  There was never a need to guess for anything behind the stdio bridge, which
  already sends the session it is running inside on every call. That is
  preferred now, and the directory inference is left for callers that send
  neither it nor a harness thread id. Still vetted rather than trusted: it goes
  through the same check as any other claim, so naming somebody else's session
  is refused rather than believed.

  The inference itself asked whether an AGENT holds an id, using the same lookup
  that resolves a hook to a mailbox. That one skips archived and closed rows,
  correctly, because mail must not be delivered to an agent that is gone; asked
  as "is this id free for somebody else", the skip was the hole. It asks whether
  the id has EVER had an owner now, archived rows included, which is what a
  swept agent leaves behind: a sweep archives, and the row is only removed after
  seven days against a one-hour join window, so a recently swept id always still
  has one. An id nobody has ever held is still joined, which is what the
  inference is for and what a companion test pins, because a refusal that
  refuses everything is indistinguishable from deleting the feature.

- **The daemon records which agent every lifecycle hook resolved to.** The wake
  path fails silently by construction: `hook_poll` answers, the agent it
  answered for is not the one asking, and nothing anywhere says so. The only
  observable is an agent reporting that its mail never arrives, which is
  indistinguishable from an agent that did not look. Three agents on this
  project's own board spent a night on exactly that and produced five
  successive, confident, mostly wrong accounts of the cause, while the daemon
  knew the answer on every single call and wrote none of them down. It logs the
  arriving session id beside the resolved agent now, at debug, and at INFO when
  a hook resolves to NOBODY in a directory that HAS agents, which is the case
  that is a fault rather than background noise. Operator-only, in the daemon's
  own log, which already redacts tokens, nonces and bodies: counts and mail are
  not in it. The arriving id is the point, because a Claude Code session carries
  several and only a coincidence makes the one the hook sends match the one
  register bound.

- **The inbox says when a sender can no longer be answered.** Mail arrives from
  agents that have since closed or been archived, and nothing said so: replying
  returned `E_NO_AGENT` with a helpful suggestion of who to try instead, so the
  board knew the answer and was computing it one call too late. `inbox` and
  `check_in` now carry `unanswerable_senders` when, and only when, some sender
  of the mail in front of you is gone, each with the same hint the send path
  would have given. It matters most for exactly the mail adoption recovers:
  inherited mail is old by definition, so its senders are the likeliest rows on
  the board to have evaporated, and the feature that rescues stranded mail is
  the one that most reliably hands you mail you cannot answer. Reported from a
  live board, where the only correct reply was to tell the sender the desk had
  changed hands. Nothing is stored: liveness is a fact about now, and
  `core.Message`'s json tags are frozen. One predicate answers it for both the
  send path and the inbox, so they cannot drift.

- **`update` can correct the working directory.** Re-registering with a
  corrected `cwd` reported `resumed: true` and kept the old value, because
  register short-circuits a same-nonce retry inside one TTL and returns the
  original result without applying anything: right for a retried registration,
  and silently a no-op for a correction spelled the same way. `pid` already had
  an escape hatch here and `cwd` had none, which made it the one field an agent
  could not fix in-session, and the matching hint BLAMES the cwd when a path
  cannot be read. So the field an agent was told was at fault was the field it
  could only change by abandoning its identity and registering a sibling. The
  project and repository travel with it, resolved by the server at ingress the
  way register resolves them, so a corrected cwd cannot leave a repo identity
  describing where the agent used to be, and an agent still cannot assert what
  repository it lives in. Reported by an agent that hit it.

- **`send` says when the recipient is active but nothing can wake it.** It
  already warned about a DORMANT recipient, and said nothing about an active one
  on a harness with no wake path, which is the more misleading of the two: an
  active row plus a silent `ok` reads as "this will arrive shortly", when in
  fact it arrives whenever a person next types into that session. Measured on a
  live board, where a request carrying a ninety-minute deadline reached an agent
  that had coordinated four minutes earlier and nothing stirred. Nothing is
  broken when this fires: some harnesses are pull-only by design and Dibs will
  not spawn a process to drive one that has not asked for it. The defect was the
  silence. It goes quiet when the board can actually wake that agent, which
  needs BOTH a `[wake.exec]` entry for the harness and a harness thread id for
  the command to resume. The first version asked only whether a command was
  CONFIGURED, so an agent with a command and no thread id got neither a wake nor
  a warning: the same silent success, one condition further along, and the test
  pinned it by using a fixture that could never have been woken. A dormant
  recipient keeps the better sentence it already had rather than collecting two
  warnings about one delivery.

- **Restoring a recovered agent's nonce rewrote history.** Archival blanks
  `Agent.Nonce` while keeping the nonce index, so an agent recovered from
  archive had no durable identity: `AgentIdentity` returned `""` and a role
  declared in `dibs.toml` could never reconcile onto it again. An admin dormant
  for a month came back as itself, with its mail and its claims, and permanently
  without its role. Putting the nonce back is correct, and doing it
  unconditionally was not: `Apply` is the fold and the fold runs over ops
  accepted by older code, so every `register` already on disk began meaning
  something different depending on which binary read it. A later same-session
  registration then skipped that row and minted a **sibling**, so one ledger
  reconstructed two different boards and `state == fold(ledger)` stopped holding
  across the upgrade. The decision is now recorded in the op (`restore_nonce`),
  the way `purge_mail` and the omitted-description flag already are:
  registrations written by this version restore, every historical one keeps the
  semantics it was written under. Found by a pre-release review round.

- **The icon shipped broken, in the copy that is compiled into the binary.** A
  `--` sequence is illegal inside an XML comment, and both icon files carry a
  design-rationale comment naming the `--accent` custom property, so neither was
  well-formed XML. An SVG that does not parse does not degrade, it does not
  render: the browser stops at the first error and draws nothing. It had never
  rendered, and a person noticed rather than the gate. The fix then landed on
  `docs/icon.svg` alone, leaving `internal/assets/icon.svg`, which `go:embed`
  compiles in and the board serves, still broken while the repository looked
  repaired: the same copy-drift shape as `SKILLS.md` and its embedded twin.
  Both are fixed and every tracked `.svg` is now parsed by the gate.

## [0.0.6] - 2026-08-20

### Security

Found by the pre-release review, which this project requires before every tag and
runs with a model that did not write the code. The first two were present in
v0.0.5 and are covered by GHSA-72hq-r6x6-mjwf; the rest existed only on this
branch and never shipped.

- **The operator's identity was claimable with a guessable credential.** The
  recovery nonce for the human's own agent was `"human:" + <OS username>`, and
  registration reattaches on a matching name and nonce and returns that
  identity's token. So any agent that could run `whoami` could become the person
  at the board: post, announce, send and read their mail as them, and on this
  branch approve its own coordinator grant, which the Touch ID path never sees
  because approving a request does not ask for a fingerprint. On an empty board
  the same call pre-creates the identity, and the operator is somebody else the
  first time they open it.

  `internal/core` has no notion of the human, deliberately, so the fold cannot
  tell that row from any other and a rule there would bind every register op
  already in a ledger. The refusal is at the engine's ingress, beside the other
  authorisation verdicts a caller is not trusted to assert.

- **Any local page could drive the board through the operator's browser.** The
  `Origin` check read the hostname and ignored the port. Cookies are scoped to a
  host and not a port, `SameSite=Strict` does not separate them either, and
  `text/plain` is CORS-safelisted, so a page on any other local port could POST
  JSON carrying a live board session with no preflight. CORS withholds the reply
  and does nothing about the effect, and the effect included `GrantRole`. Any
  local process can bind a port, which on this machine includes the agents the
  daemon exists to coordinate. The origin is now this server's own.

- **The Touch ID prompt spoke the caller's words.** `human_unlock` placed its
  `note` argument verbatim into the biometric sheet, and any agent may call it,
  so the caller chose the sentence a person read at the moment they decided
  whether to hand over their token. The prompt is now the daemon's, names the
  requesting agent, and says what is being given away; `note` is recorded in the
  result instead.

- **A single approval could perform two effects.** `grant` and `adopt` were
  admitted independently and both executed, while the prompt rendered only the
  grant, so a request could read "make X coordinator?" and move a dormant
  agent's whole mailbox on the same yes. Refused as a combination, and the
  prompt no longer depends on that.

- **A question's answers went to disk in the clear.** `choices` is message
  content and became recipient-scoped state exactly like the body beside it, and
  only the body was sealed. A copied ledger showed the alternatives next to
  ciphertext, and the alternatives are frequently the sensitive half.

### Added

- **Codex is configured over stdio, not HTTP, and that is an identity decision
  rather than a preference.** `dibs mcp-config` printed the url form for Codex,
  Codex took it, and the cost was invisible for months: an HTTP client has no
  per-session process, so nothing holds the agent's nonce, so every returning
  session registers as a sibling that cannot read its predecessor's mail. Codex
  has supported stdio all along; in a real config almost every other server uses
  it, and Dibs was the odd one out because this command said to be. The url form
  is still documented for a client on another machine, where a local bridge is
  not an option and a forked identity is the lesser problem.

- **The stdio bridge keeps the nonce, so a returning agent is the same agent.**
  This is the product's central failure, and an agent building on Dibs said it
  better than the source did: "An agent cannot be relied on to carry a secret
  across a context boundary." A persistent agent is told to keep a nonce,
  because it is the only credential that survives a restart. Then its context
  ends, which is the event the nonce exists for, and the nonce ends with it. The
  next session registers under the same name with a fresh one, becomes a
  SIBLING, and cannot read a word of its predecessor's mail.

  Measured on a real board: nine rows for five roles. `dibs-maintainer`, `-2`,
  `-3`. `codex-root`, `-2`. `codex-1`, `-2`. `web-lead`, `-2`. One created while
  fixing the others; one agent reproduced it twice in a day, the second time
  having been warned by the very response that created the first.

  The bridge is the only participant with a memory that spans sessions, so it
  keeps it: per project root and per name, stored 0600 under the data directory
  rather than in a tree somebody might commit. A returning session reattaches
  before the model has done anything. What the agent supplies still wins, and is
  remembered too. This does not help HTTP clients, which have no bridge; that
  gap is named rather than papered over.

- **An agent is told when its request is answered, and what changed.** Approval
  is the most consequential thing that can happen to an agent that asked for
  something: it may now do what it could not a moment ago, and short of
  re-reading a message it had already sent, nothing told it. The notice names
  the effect rather than the disposition, so an approved `grant` says "you now
  hold the coordinator role" and an approved `adopt` says whose mail is now
  yours. A denial says not to retry the same ask without new reasoning.

- **The agents already in a space are told when somebody joins it.** This
  notified the joiner and nobody else, which answers "what did I just join" and
  leaves "who turned up in my space" to whoever re-reads the board. Somebody
  arriving in the work you are doing is a change you did not cause and could not
  infer, which is what a notice is for.

- **`[wake] notices_wake`**, for the cost of the above. Extending a turn revives
  a thread that may be long and whose prompt cache is cold, and on a fleet of
  idle sessions that is a real bill to pay for "somebody joined your space".

  On by default, and the first version had it off, which four end-to-end checks
  caught immediately: "an agent is told what happened to it" is a guarantee this
  project already makes, and one that holds only for operators who found a
  config file is not a guarantee. The zero value is therefore the documented
  behaviour, and the field is stored inverted so that stays true for an engine
  nobody configured. Turning it off costs latency, not delivery: notices still
  queue, still ride along on any other wake, and still arrive in full at the
  agent's own `check_in`.

- **Mail reaches an agent whose harness cannot push anything.** Every
  authenticated mutating result now carries a `waiting` line when the caller has
  unread mail, an unacknowledged announcement, or a pending agent update: counts
  and the corrective call, never content. Push delivery through lifecycle hooks
  is conditional on four things (the harness having hooks, the plugin being
  installed, it having loaded before the session started, and the agent having
  registered with the session id the hook quotes) and each of them is a real way
  to end up believing mail arrives by itself. Measured on a live board: an agent
  registered out of band sat on unread mail while `dibs doctor` reported hooks
  resolving perfectly, because they were, for everybody else. A tool result is
  the one channel that always exists and cannot be misrouted, because it returns
  down the connection the caller authenticated on.

- **Registering with no session id says so, and says what it costs.** That
  registration used to draw the "no lifecycle hook has reached this daemon"
  text, which sends the agent to audit a plugin that is very likely fine. No
  hook can resolve an agent that has no session id, however well the plugin is
  installed, so the result now names that and the way back (re-register with the
  same name and nonce) instead.

- **A human running a terminal harness can see what Dibs is doing.** The wake
  hook returns `systemMessage` alongside the model-facing digest: one line, to
  the person rather than the model, costing the agent no context. The board is
  an MCP Apps panel and terminal hosts do not render those, so everything Dibs
  did for those operators happened in silence.

- **`UserPromptSubmit` joins the Claude Code wake hooks**, so mail that arrived
  while the agent was idle lands when the human's next turn starts rather than
  waiting out the turn after it.

- **`update` revises what an agent says about itself**: `name`, `description`,
  and the self-reported half of its identity (`title`, `branch`, `model`,
  `provider`, `effort`, `surface`). An agent picks its name in its first seconds
  and boards fill with `agent`, `claude-1` and `worker`: nine rows that are all
  synonyms for "an agent". The id never changes, because it is the address every
  message, claim and membership keys on, and a name another live agent holds is
  refused (`E_NAME_TAKEN`) rather than suffixed, since two live agents sharing a
  name redirects mail between them. `harness` and `version` stay unsettable:
  the client states those, which is the one part of the board that is not a
  model's word for itself. `register` now also answers a placeholder name at the
  moment it is chosen.

- **A question to the human is answerable from the notification.** It used to
  raise a banner, which is a notification that the board has something on it:
  the person still had to go and open the board, and the asking agent waited out
  its deadline while they decided whether to. Requests have had approve/deny
  buttons since notifications landed; questions had nothing.

  `send` now takes `choices` (up to four). Up to three become the buttons
  themselves, so answering is one press with nothing to type and no window to
  find. A fourth does not fit on a notification, so that case, and a question
  with no choices at all, offers `Later` and an opt-in, which then opens a list
  or a text box.

  Nothing takes the screen until the person has pressed something asking it to,
  and that ordering is the design rather than a detail: raising a text box on
  arrival is fewer steps and is a coordination service deciding that its
  optional question outranks whatever they were doing. `planAnswer` is split
  from the osascript that performs it so the rule is testable, because the part
  with a rule in it is the part a rewrite loses.

  The choices are on the MESSAGE and therefore in the ledger, not a property of
  the notification that raised them: a question replayed without its options is
  a different question. Agents see them in `inbox` like any other field, so an
  enumerated answer space is worth stating whoever is receiving it.

- **Touch ID opens the web board, and no password is needed where it works.**
  `dibs doctor` warned "no admin password set, so the web board cannot be
  opened" on every Mac with a working sensor, and the remedy it named was to
  invent and store a credential in order to be trusted LESS. The presence
  machinery had existed since the panel's `human_unlock`, whose own comment says
  it: a password proves possession of a secret an agent could in principle have
  been handed, while a fingerprint proves somebody is sitting there. The gate
  went on demanding the weaker of the two, and `guard.go` had carried a note
  saying "presence upgrade can later replace the password" the whole time.

  The check runs in the DAEMON, never in the client. A caller that reported "I
  verified presence" would be asserting it, and every agent on the machine holds
  the local secret needed to make that assertion. Presence is also still the
  SECOND factor: same-user AND a person who consented just now.

  The password stays, because presence is genuinely absent on Linux, on Macs
  without the sensor, and in a headless session. Declined and unavailable are
  answered differently by the daemon, because they mean different things to
  anything calling `/bootstrap`. And a `dibs web` whose stdin is not a terminal
  never raises a sheet at all, since a script piping a password is telling you
  it cannot reach a sensor. `dibs web --password` forces it.

  `dibs web` falls back to the password on EVERY presence failure, not just on
  an unavailable sensor. The tempting rule is to stop on a decline, so that
  somebody who just said no is not immediately asked for a credential; it is
  right about a real decline and wrong about everything it cannot be told apart
  from. The helper reports "declined" for a cancel, a failed match and its own
  timeout alike, so a sheet that never reached the screen looks exactly like a
  refusal. That is not hypothetical: on the machine this was written on,
  `evaluatePolicy` accepted the policy, reported Touch ID present and enrolled,
  and never called back at all. Stopping there would leave the operator with
  ninety seconds of nothing and no way in, on the one command whose job is to
  let them in.

- **Dibs reports its own faults to the coordinator, and asks for a patch.** A
  service that notices something wrong with itself and writes it to a log has
  told nobody: the operator is not tailing it, which is the same premise this
  whole product rests on. Faults now go to whoever holds the coordinator role,
  or to the human when nobody does, as ordinary mail: same envelope, same
  mailbox, same wake path, visible on the board and replayable. A private
  channel for system messages would be a second delivery mechanism to keep
  working and the first thing to rot.

  Every report ends on something the reader can do, and what that is depends on
  whose fault it is. Configuration gets the remedy precisely, because it is
  theirs to apply, and still names the repository in case the remedy does not
  work. A defect gets the repository, the failing path, and an invitation to
  FIX it: the agent reading it is holding a reproducible fault in a Go codebase
  with the path named, which is a better starting point than whoever reads the
  issue later will have. Asking for a bug report gets a bug report; asking for a
  patch sometimes gets a patch, and a contributor.

  Dibs speaks as an ordinary participant to do it, minted on first fault rather
  than at startup, so a board where nothing has gone wrong carries no row for
  the thing that reports what goes wrong. A report without a remedy is refused
  at the door, because that is an alarm and this is the file that exists to not
  produce those. One report per kind per run, so a fault that recurs every sweep
  does not become a message every sweep.

- **An agent can ask for its old identity back, and approving moves the mail.**
  `send(to: "coordinator", type: "request", adopt: "<the abandoned id>")`. The
  approver's yes performs the adoption; there is nothing left to run.

  This is the fix for the duplicates a real board accumulates. `dibs-maintainer`,
  `-2` and `-3`; `codex-root` and `-2`; `codex-1` and `-2`: every one is an agent
  that came back, could not prove it was itself, and started again beside its own
  unread mail. The recovery path already existed and needed the human at the
  machine or a coordinator, which is an authority the returning agent does not
  have and cannot get from where it is standing. So the honest reading of the
  warning was "your mail is gone", and the only reachable action was to carry on
  as a sibling. The warning now ends on something the agent can do unaided.

  Approving one still needs exactly the authority that performing one needs,
  recorded at ingress like every other verdict, so replay applies the decision
  that was made rather than re-deciding it against a board whose roles have
  moved on.

- **`to: "coordinator"` addresses whoever holds the role.** An agent asking for
  its identity back should not have to work out which of sixteen rows is the
  coordinator today, or notice when it changes hands. Resolved at ingress, so
  the ledger records the agent it actually went to: a message addressed to a
  role and replayed after the role moved would otherwise be delivered to
  somebody it was never sent to. A live holder wins over a dormant one, because
  addressing a role has to reach somebody who can answer, and the result is
  stable across calls: map iteration is random, and "the first one found" would
  scatter a role's mail across however many hold it.

- **An agent asks for a role and your Approve grants it.** `send(to: <the human
  row>, type: "request", grant: "coordinator")` raises a notification whose
  button says what pressing it does, and pressing it promotes them. There is no
  second step.

  Before this, the loop stopped one move short of useful: the agent asked, the
  notification appeared, the human pressed Approve, and then had to open a
  terminal and type `dibs admin coordinator <agent>`. Two steps for one
  decision, and the second is where it died: the approval sat answered on the
  board while the agent stayed unable to do the thing it had just been told it
  could. A `request` is free prose, so Dibs could not know that approving one
  meant granting anything; `grant` is the typed field that makes the yes
  actionable.

  Three rules keep it from being self-promotion with extra steps. Only the human
  may receive one, checked in the engine because `core` does not know humans
  exist and that ignorance is what keeps it a pure state machine: without it two
  agents could promote each other by approving in turn. Only a `request` may
  carry one, because it is the only type with an approve. And **admin is refused
  outright**: coordinator is breadth (broadcast, force_release) and cannot read
  anybody's mail, while admin is the god view including every agent's decrypted
  mail, which is not something to hand over on a notification tapped between two
  others.

  The notification's title is composed by the DAEMON from the typed field, not
  from the sender's prose. It is the only line stating the effect of pressing
  Approve, so a request whose body reads "just need to check something" cannot
  carry `grant: coordinator` past somebody who never saw the word.

- **`retitle_space`**, so a topic can be redacted without destroying the space.

- A hygiene guard against the wreckage a find-and-replace leaves when one word
  used to mean two things, which is how the last one went.

- **`task release VERSION=x.y.z`**, because the release pipeline had exactly one
  hand-edited step left and it drifted twice. AGENTS.md says of that pipeline
  that "no source is updated by hand: if the three ever disagree, that is a bug
  in the pipeline, not a chore"; claiming the changelog's Unreleased section and
  stamping four manifests was still a chore. It stamps and stops, because
  tagging publishes signed artifacts, moves the Homebrew cask and writes to the
  MCP registry, and that stays the owner's to perform. `internal/release` is the
  one declaration of what carries a version, used by both the thing that writes
  it and the thing that checks it, so a manifest cannot be stamped and unchecked
  or checked and unstamped.

- **`dibs upgrade`**: one command to move a running fleet onto a new build.
  R12 settled the client half of this (the bridge waits out the restart window
  and re-sends only requests that provably never arrived); this is the operator
  half. It runs the new binary against the ledger first, through a new
  `dibd -check` that replays without serving and is safe against a board another
  daemon is holding, and stops nothing unless that passes: a binary that cannot
  fold the ledger the old one wrote is otherwise discovered only after the
  daemon that could serve the board is gone. Then it repoints a service unit
  pinning the wrong daemon, restarts through the service manager where there is
  one, restores the address the daemon was bound to (a fleet spanning machines
  is not on loopback, and coming back there would take every remote agent off
  the board while every local check passed), and waits for the board before
  reporting the serial and agent count it returned with. Anything that fails
  between the stop and the start restarts the daemon on the build it was already
  running. `--adopt-dir` also renames a data directory an older version named,
  in the one order that works. `dibs doctor` now names this command instead of
  handing back shell steps whose order was load-bearing and unstated.

  Two rules in it were paid for on a live board, by the first real run. A
  service unit is RELOADED before it is restarted, always: launchd reads a plist
  at load time and holds the parsed definition, so rewriting the file changes
  nothing it knows and `kickstart` exits 0 having scheduled the old program.
  Unconditionally, because a plist edited by hand or by an earlier failed run
  drifts the same way and presents identically. And a restart is not believed
  until the BOARD answers: marking it done when the start call returned meant
  the recovery could not fire on the one failure that matters, and the fleet
  stayed down while the command reported the failure and exited.

### Fixed

- **Pinning an agent's identity broke every call that agent then made.** The
  transport nonce counted as a supplied argument for every tool, while the
  unknown-argument check exempts only `token`, so an agent whose harness pinned
  its identity was refused `check_in` with a schema complaint about an argument
  it never sent. That is the call every agent must make at the start of every
  activation, so configuring the feature broke the agent that configured it.

- **`dibd -check` repaired the board it was asked to inspect.** It replays a
  board to answer whether this build could take over from the daemon now
  running, and `dibs upgrade` runs it before the cutover, which means while the
  old daemon may still be serving. It opened the ledger read-write, so it
  created files in a directory it does not own and truncated a torn final
  line, and a torn final line is what a running writer looks like from outside.
  Measured with a 17-byte partial record: the command reported success and left
  the ledger at 0 bytes. It now loads rather than creates, opens read-only, and
  reports a torn tail instead of repairing it.

- **The bridge's memory outranked the operator's configuration.** A remembered
  nonce was injected into the arguments before the pinned identity was attached
  as a header, and the daemon prefers a stated nonce over a transport one, so
  `DIBS_AGENT_NONCE` was silently overruled and the session reattached to
  whichever agent the bridge happened to remember.

- **One checkout was several identities.** The bridge's nonce store said it
  keyed by repository root and nothing supplied one, so every session was keyed
  by the exact subdirectory it started in: the same role launched from the
  repository root and from a subdirectory became two agents. It now walks up for
  the checkout.

- **The nonce store could lose every identity on the machine.** An unlocked
  read-modify-truncate-write of a file every bridge shares, and a decode failure
  reads as an empty map, so one interrupted write discarded the lot. Each lost
  entry is a fresh nonce and therefore a sibling. Serialised and written
  atomically now.

- **A branch-only `update` erased the agent's description.** The tool invites
  branch-only and title-only calls, and an omitted field and an explicitly
  emptied one were the same value by the time the op was built.

- **Approving a request from an agent that had retired still performed it.** The
  role was granted to an agent that cannot act, and an adopted mailbox was moved
  into one whose token has been blanked and which cannot resume, so a
  coordinator approving a rescue moved the rescued mail somewhere unreadable and
  was told it worked.

- **The board could be framed.** Cookies are host-scoped and not port-scoped, so
  a page on another local port could frame the authenticated board with its
  session attached and drive it through its own script, whose origin is this
  daemon's. `frame-ancestors 'none'` and `X-Frame-Options: DENY` now.

- **A fault found before anybody was on the board was never retried.** The
  startup reachability check runs before any agent has registered, so there was
  nobody to tell, and nothing tried again once somebody arrived.

- **Two shipped plugins read the daemon's secret from a directory it left
  behind, and failed silently when it was not there.** `plugins/opencode` and
  `plugins/pi` defaulted `DIBS_DIR` to `~/.agents`. The daemon has used
  `~/.dibs` since 0.0.3 and reads the old name only as a legacy directory, so on
  any install made since, both plugins looked for `local.secret` where nothing
  was. Neither says so: the read is wrapped, returns null, and every hook in
  both files returns null on a null key. The agent registered no delivery hook,
  nothing was logged, and mail simply never arrived, which is indistinguishable
  from a quiet board. Both now resolve the way the daemon resolves, preferring
  `~/.dibs` and falling back to the legacy directory only when that is the one
  that exists.

- **A missing SPACE said "no agent" and sent the agent to look at the roster.**
  Nine call sites keyed on a space id answered `E_NO_AGENT`, while `E_NO_SPACE`
  existed alongside them and was used in six others. The hints were the
  expensive half: `join_space` against a space nobody had opened answered
  `no agent ghost`, hint `open_space it, or list agents first`. Dibs holds that
  every error carries a hint naming the corrective call; this named the wrong
  noun and then the wrong call. `join`, `leave`, `post`, `watch`, `retitle`,
  `close`, `merge` and both watch paths now answer `E_NO_SPACE`. `E_NO_SPACE`
  was also missing from SPEC §12's list of codes, before any of this.

- **Three hints told an agent to "read the agent with `read_space`".** The 0.0.3
  rename left `core.AgentMatch.Agent` holding a space id, so everything written
  about that field came out saying agent when it meant space. The field is now
  `Space`, which is what the two rounds of repair above and below both trace
  back to.

- **The hermes plugin told the reader to install a binary that has never
  existed** (`hermes mcp add agents --command "$(which agents)"`), six lines
  above its own output showing `command: .../bin/dibs`. It and `plugins/pi`
  also advertised a stale count of 25 against a server publishing 44 of them: no
  plugin README was read by the tool-count guard, and hermes stated the number
  in a shape the guard cannot match, so both halves had to be wrong for it to
  survive. The guard now reads every plugin document.

- **The README, the tutorial and SPEC-CHANNELS described matching as something
  you switch on.** It has indexed every repository the fleet works in since
  0.0.5, and measured its own notify threshold since. The README's section was
  headed "Turning it on", SPEC-CHANNELS promised in its fourth line that spaces
  are inert until `-match-repo` is passed, and the tutorial told the reader to
  restart the daemon to set a flag that no longer does anything, including a
  `dibs doctor` transcript showing a check the command has not printed since.

- **A full board refused registrations while naming the wrong ceiling.** One
  static error read "maximum number of agents reached" for both caps, so an
  operator hitting the PERSISTENT limit checked `max_agents`, found the board a
  quarter full, and had been told something true and useless. Found by running
  the thing: a board holding 16 agents of a possible 64 refused a new one,
  because all 16 were persistent and that ceiling is 16. Each cap now names
  itself, its number, and its own remedy, which differ: a full board wants
  finished agents signed off, while a full persistent board usually means
  siblings accumulated and wants them reclaimed.

- **`max_persistent_agents` and `max_agents` are settable**, which the hint
  above tells people to do and which was not previously possible. A persistent
  ceiling above the total is refused rather than accepted, because the lower one
  binds and the setting would otherwise read as applied while doing nothing.

- **One unreadable directory switched work-overlap matching off for the whole
  board.** An agent registering from a tree macOS will not let the daemon read
  set the GLOBAL phase to `off`, replacing a working index for every other
  repository with "matching is off" and a hint pointing at one directory. A
  fleet lost the feature for a day to it. Reported by an agent that had lost it
  and traced the cause correctly.

  A tree that cannot be read is now named in `unreadable` and belongs to the
  agent that registered from it; the phase stays whatever the rest of the board
  earned, and only goes `off` when nothing at all is indexed, because then the
  two statements coincide.

  The same shape two lines above it: every registration set the phase to
  `indexing`, so a fleet that had been matching for an hour reported itself as
  starting up whenever a new agent joined, and anything declaring in that window
  was told matching was not ready.

- **`task install` proves the signature is stable instead of asserting it.**
  macOS ties a Files-and-Folders grant to a program's code-directory hash, so a
  hash that moves silently revokes the permission and the operator is asked
  again by a dialog that explains none of it. The stable identity fixed that;
  nothing checked it was still true. It had been verified once, by hand, by
  somebody who then promised it would not recur, which is precisely the kind of
  claim this repository does not accept anywhere else. `tools/signstable`
  records what each install signed and fails the next one if it changed, naming
  both hashes and the two commands that diagnose it. Ad-hoc builds are exempt
  and say so, because their hash changes by design and failing every install on
  a machine with no identity would teach everyone to ignore the check.

- **The panel no longer pushes anything into model context, and the daemon no
  longer gives it the material to.** `maybeShareMailWithAgent` called
  `ui/update-model-context` with the body of every unread message. It existed as
  the only push a host without lifecycle hooks could offer, and it did not do
  that job: by the Apps contract it does not start a turn, which the code said
  itself, so the mail surfaced when the HUMAN next typed. That is the operator
  acting as the transport, which is the failure this product exists to remove,
  arriving through the one door nobody was watching. What it did in practice was
  put every unread message, in full, into their composer.

  Removed, not trimmed. Waking an agent belongs to the lifecycle hooks and to
  the `waiting` line on every authenticated result; a panel shows a person their
  board.

  Removing it was not enough on its own. MCP Apps templates are cached by the
  host against their `ui://` URI, so a session that loaded the panel before the
  fix keeps running the old JavaScript and keeps leaking, with nothing the
  server can do about it. So the bodies also stop leaving the daemon: the panel
  payload carries serials, senders, types and states, and the text travels only
  on the panel's own authenticated bridge, where a host has no claim to it. A
  cached panel cannot share what it was never given.

  Four e2e checks asserted the old behaviour, carefully: that the push was
  framed as data rather than instruction, that it never claimed to wake anyone,
  and that concurrent pushes coalesced. All true, all of a feature that should
  not have existed. They now assert zero pushes, with the reasoning kept.

- **A guard against the leak that keeps coming back through a new door.** The
  same defect has now appeared three times in three channels: the wake digest
  listing each message with its text, `dibs://inbox` returning the whole
  mailbox, and both reported by the operator watching their own prompt box fill
  with mail addressed to an agent. `TestNoWakeSurfaceLeaksAMessageBody` asserts
  the rule over every surface a host may attach to a human's turn, as a property
  rather than three examples, because the failure keeps arriving somewhere
  nobody thought to look. The rule is one sentence: these say who is waiting and
  what kind, never what was said, and the content is fetched with a
  token-authenticated call.

- **A fault report goes to somebody who can READ it.** It asked
  `CoordinatorID`, which answers "who holds the role". On a board whose only
  coordinator is dormant, that is an agent which may never come back, so the
  report was filed correctly into a mailbox nobody opens: this feature's own
  failure mode, with an extra step. Measured here, where the standing
  coordinator had been dormant for a day while the operator was at the keyboard
  throughout, and Dibs' warning that it could not reach them by notification
  went to the one row guaranteed not to see it. A live coordinator first, then
  the human, then a dormant coordinator as a last resort.

- **A request to a PERSON gets a person's deadline.** The default was ten
  minutes for every recipient. That is right for an agent: it is in a loop, it
  answers in seconds, and a stale question should expire rather than linger. A
  human is not in a loop, which is the premise this entire product rests on, and
  this one default contradicted it.

  Measured here, on the request that would have made the maintainer a
  coordinator: sent, delivered, never seen because a Focus mode swallowed the
  notification, and expired thirty minutes later as
  `expired_recipient_dormant` while the operator was away from the machine. The
  feature worked exactly as built. The clock was set for somebody else.

  A day now, when the recipient is the human and the sender named no deadline.
  Well inside the seven days a persistent recipient already allowed, so a sender
  who wants longer can ask, and an explicit deadline still wins in both
  directions. Agent-to-agent mail keeps the short default, because "every
  deadline is a day" would leave stale questions on every board for a day apiece.

- **A sibling shares the NAME, never the ROLE, and the resend advice did not say
  so.** Mail to a dormant agent returns "X is LIVE under the same name and is
  almost certainly who you meant. Resend to X." That is right when you meant a
  peer doing a job, and wrong when you meant an authority.

  Found in the wild within an hour of the reclaim path shipping, by the first
  agent to use it in earnest. It needed a coordinator to approve an adoption,
  addressed the agent holding that role, found it dormant, followed this advice
  to the live sibling, and asked an agent with no role at all. It opened by
  telling that agent it held the coordinator role, because the note had said so
  in everything but the word. Neither end could see that the authority had been
  dropped in transit. The advice now says when the sibling lacks the role, what
  that costs (approving an adoption or a grant, force_release, evict), and names
  the human as the reachable alternative.

- **Confidentiality: `dibs://inbox` published message bodies to whoever the host
  decided.** An MCP resource is APPLICATION-controlled: the host chooses what to
  do with one, and attaching it to the user's next turn is an ordinary thing for
  a host to do. This resource returned the whole mailbox, bodies included, so
  one agent's private mail was rendered into its operator's prompt box, prefixed
  with the resource's own name. Reported that way: "it starts with `inbox:` and
  a message from another agent."

  Two failures in one change: mail reaching a reader it was not addressed to,
  and the human put back in the loop as a relay. The resource now carries the
  SIGNAL and the tool carries the content: counts, senders, types and serials,
  plus the call that reads them. That is the rule Dibs already applies to the
  human's notification and to the `waiting` line, "counts and senders only,
  never content", and this was the one place it was not applied. The
  subscription still says "there is new mail", which is all a wake needs.

- **Security: a role grant could be approved by an agent, not only by the
  human.** The engine checked that a request carrying `grant` was ADDRESSED to
  the human when it was sent, and approval trusted the recipient from then on.
  Adoption rewrites the recipient of every message in a mailbox, and a
  coordinator may adopt, so: an agent asks the human for coordinator, the
  human's row goes dormant (which needs no arranging, since silence is a
  person's whole liveness model), a coordinator adopts that mailbox, inherits
  the pending request, and approves it. No human anywhere in the story. Closed
  twice: the human's mailbox is not adoptable by anybody else, which the
  coordinator boundary already implied and did not enforce, and approving a
  grant re-checks the human at APPROVAL time.

- **`op_id` dedup ignored the fields that carry the effect** (`grant`, `adopt`,
  `choices`), so a retry reusing an op_id with a changed `grant` returned
  `{"ok": true, "deduplicated": true}` over a message that granted nothing.

- **Three new validation rules sat in `Apply` instead of `Admit`**, which makes
  them retroactive replay rules: the day the accepted roles change is the day
  the daemon refuses to boot on its own history. This is the mistake AGENTS.md
  names first. The tests reinforced it by asserting rejection at `Apply`.

- **Three new engine paths read core state off the single-writer loop**,
  including one called from an HTTP handler. `e.human.mu` guards the cached
  human fields and nothing in core, so those were data races and candidates for
  a concurrent map read-and-write panic.

- **A notification that could not be SHOWN was reported as one nobody
  answered**, so a question the operator could never see was indistinguishable
  from one they ignored, and the asker waited out its deadline.

- **A fault was marked reported before it was delivered**, on four paths. The
  startup reachability check is exactly when that bites, since it runs before
  anybody has registered.

- **The notification says WHO is asking.** "Dibs · make asker coordinator?" is
  not enough to approve a privilege change on: a name is self-chosen and often
  three variations of one word. It leads with the daemon-assigned id and where
  the agent works, placed ABOVE the sender's own text.

- **Tests can no longer notify a real person.** `go test ./...` put alerts on
  the operator's screen carrying fixture text, with buttons that answered a
  process which had already exited, and the product was then reported broken on
  the evidence of its own test suite.

- **`core.Message`'s json tags and two op-kind strings were frozen by nothing**,
  though a message is state and state is a fold over the ledger.

- **Mail no longer rides on the human's prompt.** `UserPromptSubmit` fires when
  a PERSON types, and its `additionalContext` is attached to their message, so
  delivering a wake digest there made the operator the transport: an agent
  learned that a peer was waiting when, and only when, its human happened to say
  something. That is the failure Dibs exists to remove, shipped as a feature.
  Worse, that path had no freshness throttle (only `Stop` did), so the same
  unread message was attached to every prompt they sent until somebody read it.
  Reported from a live fleet: "it's putting it on my plate to take an action for
  them to notice, agents should be notified directly."

  `Stop` still pushes and keeps its loop guard, `SessionStart` still tells a new
  session what is waiting, and the `waiting` line still reaches an agent that
  neither can. None of those need a person to type.

- **The Codex plugin says how to wire its wake path, and stops contradicting
  itself about whether one exists.** Codex reads hooks from `~/.codex/hooks.json`,
  a different file from `config.toml`; nothing said so, so the MCP server got
  configured and the hooks file never did. The README meanwhile carried two
  sections: one announcing that the `mcp_tool` hook variant had arrived, and,
  directly below it, one stating as current fact that "there is no `mcp_tool`
  and no `http` variant". Both were checked in, and the shipped `hooks.json` was
  written against the true one, so a reader had no way to tell which described
  the product. This is the drift class this repository is most expensive at, in
  the file whose whole job is to tell somebody how to install the thing.

- **Pressing "Answer" on a notification now has somewhere to put the answer.**
  The notification comes from Dibs' application bundle, because only that API
  carries buttons and only a bundle carries an identity. The text box that
  opened when somebody pressed Answer did not: it was an osascript
  `display dialog`, and a background LaunchAgent has no foreground application
  for a dialog to belong to. So the press dismissed the notification, osascript
  ran, and nothing appeared. Reported exactly that way: "when I clicked answer
  it just went away, there was nowhere to put an answer." Both halves of
  answering now come from the bundle, as a native alert that activates, because
  stealing focus is correct one gesture after somebody asked for it.

- **Dibs says when it cannot reach you, instead of reporting success into
  silence.** A coordinator request was posted, macOS accepted it, an active
  Focus mode swallowed the banner, and every layer reported success: the board
  said "delivered", the agent waited out its deadline, and the operator asked
  why they had seen nothing. The notifier's "authorisation refused" exit was
  also being read as "the human did not answer", so a silenced Dibs and an
  ignored one were the same value. `dibs doctor` now reports whether a
  notification would actually be SEEN, naming the cause: a Focus mode, a
  revoked grant, permission never asked for, or every alert style switched off.
  A question or request also asks to break through Focus as Time Sensitive,
  since buttons are the tell that somebody is blocked on the answer.

- **`signcheck` stopped refusing installs it no longer needs to refuse.** It
  blocked an ad-hoc install whenever a usable identity sat unused in the
  keychain, which was right when using one meant naming it in an environment
  variable. `tools/signid` resolves it by name now, so that situation cannot
  arise, and the refusal turned a solved problem into a blocked install. Two
  tools that decide the same thing have to decide it the same way; this one was
  left behind by the other, an hour after the other was written.

- **`task install` finds Dibs' own signing identity by name, so the macOS
  permission prompt stops repeating.** macOS keys a Files-and-Folders grant to a
  program's code signature; the Go toolchain signs ad-hoc, so every rebuild is a
  different program and the grant stops applying. `tools/signcheck` has warned
  about this and named the remedy since it was written, but the remedy only
  worked if the operator then passed `DIBS_CODESIGN_IDENTITY` on every install
  forever, and one install that forgot silently went back to ad-hoc and revoked
  the grant again. A fix conditional on remembering is not one.

  `tools/signid` resolves it: the environment variable if set, else Dibs' own
  identity if it is actually in the keychain, else ad-hoc. Create the
  certificate once and every later install keeps the grant, with nothing to set.

  Measured on the machine this was written on: nine installs in one session,
  nine permission prompts, and the operator asking why. The warning printed all
  nine times, into output nobody was reading.

  The install also says which of the two happened, in ONE line. It briefly said
  both: `status:` is a task-level field rather than a per-command one, so two
  guarded commands both ran and consecutive lines claimed the grant would and
  would not survive.

- **The human's row on the board reported `process gone` after every daemon
  restart.** The human registers as a participant so agents have somewhere to
  address a request, and it recorded `os.Getpid()`: the daemon's own pid, which
  is the one pid guaranteed to be alive at the moment it is written and gone by
  the next start. The liveness sweep then found a dead process and honestly
  reported what it saw. A person is not a process, so `Op.NoProcess` now says
  that a participant HAS none, which is different from omitting a pid and is
  why it needed a field: omitting one means "unchanged", so nothing could ever
  clear a pid recorded earlier.

  Boards that already ran the old build heal themselves at the next daemon
  start, because nothing else would: the human's registration is rewritten only
  when they ACT, so an operator who reads their board and closes it would be
  told `process gone` about themselves indefinitely. The repair is an `update`
  rather than a re-registration, which is a distinction that cost a debugging
  round: `register` short-circuits a same-nonce retry inside one TTL and returns
  the original result WITHOUT applying the op, which is right for a retried
  registration and silently a no-op for a correction spelled as one. It fires
  only on a board that already has a human, and only while a pid is recorded, so
  it repairs rather than recruits and does not append a record a day to say
  nothing.

- **The wire-format guard was checking a third of the wire format.** Renaming an
  op's json tag is silent data loss here (`lane_kind` → `agent_kind` demoted
  every persistent agent on upgrade, in every release to v0.0.4), and
  `TestLedgerFieldNamesAreFrozen` exists to catch exactly that. It fingerprinted
  the tags a hand-written fixture happened to populate, so 17 tags, including
  every field of `update` and `adopt_agent`, were free to be renamed by the next
  sweep with the guard passing. It now reflects over `core.Op` itself, so a
  field is guarded because it exists rather than because somebody remembered to
  exercise it.

- **The stdio bridge upgrades itself in place, so a fix no longer waits for
  every harness on the machine to restart.** A bridge is spawned once per
  session and held for its lifetime, so installing a new `dibs` did nothing to
  the one already running: an agent kept talking to the build it started with,
  for days. Every bridge fix was therefore gated on restarting every harness,
  which is precisely the ceremony R12 refuses to charge for a daemon upgrade and
  has no better claim to here. The session-repair above rides in the bridge, so
  the agent whose mail was going undelivered would have kept not receiving it
  until its session ended.

  `syscall.Exec` is the whole mechanism, and it works because of what exec does
  not touch: the process keeps its pid and its file descriptors, so stdin and
  stdout stay the pipes the harness is holding, and from the harness's side
  nothing happened. It fires only between a reply and the next request, only
  when this process's own read buffer is empty (buffered bytes live in memory,
  not in the pipe, so an exec would discard a batched request), and it carries
  the handshake identity and every open subscription across in the environment.
  Subscriptions are re-issued as the caller's own request, never reconstructed,
  which is the rule followStream already follows across a daemon restart.

- **A bridge can no longer outlive its harness, by construction.** One bridge
  exists per session, so a bridge that fails to exit is one orphan per session,
  each holding a stream open against the daemon forever. EOF on stdin cannot
  prevent that, because the bridge sees EOF only when the LAST holder of the
  pipe's write end closes it, and a harness that also spawns shells hands each
  one the same descriptors: a Claude Code killed while a Bash tool is running
  leaves the write end open and the bridge waiting on a pipe nobody will write
  to again. The lifetime is now bound to the PROCESS by the kernel, on both
  supported platforms: `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` on Linux, which holds even if the
  bridge is wedged, and kqueue `EVFILT_PROC`/`NOTE_EXIT` on macOS. Both re-check
  `getppid` afterwards, because the parent can die in the window before
  registering, and a reparented process is an orphan by definition.

  Those paths exit rather than unwind, which is the part that makes the
  guarantee real: cancelling a context does not interrupt a blocking read on
  stdin, so a bridge parked in that read never looks at the cancellation again.
  Measured: with a sibling holding the write end, a bridge outlived a SIGKILLed
  harness indefinitely with its context already cancelled. Shutdown also waits a
  bounded time for its stream goroutines and then goes anyway, because the
  guarantee has to be that the process exits, not that it exits if its
  goroutines cooperate. SIGTERM and SIGINT end it cleanly, flushing first.

- **A bridge holding a subscription never exited when its harness closed
  stdin.** `followStream` re-issues the listen every time the stream ends, which
  is what keeps a subscription alive across a daemon restart and, with no way to
  stop it, also kept it alive across the session going away: the bridge then
  waited forever on a goroutine that reconnected forever. Found by closing stdin
  on a bridge that had one.

- **`adopt_agent`, for a mailbox nobody can log back into.** An agent that
  registered with neither a nonce nor a session id can never be reattached, and
  its mailbox keeps accepting mail no one can read. Found on this project's own
  board, holding six unreachable messages. It moves that mail onto a live agent;
  the source record and its history stay, because the ledger refers to them, and
  roles do not move with it. Authorised outside the fold, by the human proven
  present at the machine or somebody they promoted, and the verdict is recorded
  in the op the way a coordinator claim already is: taking another agent's mail
  is otherwise the one thing Dibs must never allow, so there is no
  agent-to-agent version.

- **docs/CONFIGURATION.md**: every setting the daemon accepts, in one place,
  with what happens if you leave it alone. Twenty-four keys were spread across
  five documents with no reference anywhere, and an unknown key stops the daemon
  rather than being ignored, so a setting somebody reads about and cannot use is
  not a small slip: it is a daemon that will not start, blamed on the manual
  that suggested it. A guard checks both directions, reading the struct tags
  rather than a list somebody maintains.

- **`man 8 dibd`.** The daemon had no manual. It is what an operator installs as
  a service, points at a listen address and configures with a file, while the
  CLI, which is discoverable by typing `dibs help`, has had a page since it had
  verbs. Generated from the daemon's own flags, which are now declared once for
  both parsing and documentation, and both pages are checked with `mandoc
  -Tlint` in CI. The CLI's page also stopped calling itself `agents.1`.

- **Agents can reach the human, and the human is notified on the machine.** The
  person is the one participant with no loop: no lifecycle hook fires for them
  and no tool result reaches them, so mail addressed to them waited until they
  next opened the board. The board now marks their row `human: true` so an agent
  can find who to write to, and a message to that row raises a desktop
  notification. A `request` carries **Deny / Later / Approve on the banner
  itself**, and the button pressed comes back as an ordinary response from their
  own agent: the sender cannot tell it came from a notification rather than a
  tool call, which is the point.

- **Dibs.app is built by an install from source, not shipped in the archives.**
  Said here because the two entries around this one promise banner buttons and a
  named sender, and a `brew install` or a downloaded archive gets neither: they
  carry `dibs` and `dibd` only. Notifications still arrive; they arrive without
  the actions and under the poster's borrowed identity.

  It is not an oversight in the release build. macOS remembers notification
  authorisation against the SIGNATURE, and the identity Dibs signs with is
  created on the operator's own machine by `task install`. A bundle signed in CI
  would be ad-hoc, which means a different application to macOS on every build,
  which revokes the grant every time: worse than not shipping one. `task install`
  builds it, signs it with your identity, and the grant then survives rebuilds.

- **Dibs.app**, because a notification carries the identity of whoever posts it.
  A daemon shelling out to `osascript` borrows Script Editor's name and icon, so
  every message from an agent arrived branded "osascript"; there is no flag that
  changes that, the poster's bundle IS the identity. The bundle also buys the
  action buttons: `UNUserNotificationCenter` needs a bundle identifier and is
  the only API that puts them on the banner. The product mark is rendered from
  the same nine numbers as `icon.svg` (a rounded tile, three polylines, a dot)
  rather than parsed, so producing an icon needs no build dependency, and a
  guard keeps the two from diverging. `LSUIElement`, so notifying never bounces
  a Dock icon or steals focus.

- **Mail wakes its recipient when it arrives, once.** An agent hearing about a
  message only when somebody next types at it is not situational awareness, and
  a time-sensitive request sitting unseen because nobody was at the keyboard is
  the failure this product exists to prevent.

  This was got wrong in both directions first. `additionalContext` on a `Stop`
  hook "keeps the conversation going", so every unread message extended a
  finished turn, a plain FYI included, and eight in a row could burn eight
  turns. Narrowing delivery to work somebody was blocked on fixed the symptom
  and broke the point: driving a harness means INSTRUCTING it, and the digest
  already says it is coordination data the agent may act on or decline. The
  agency is in the content, not in withholding delivery until a human appears.

  What deserved the name was nagging, and that is a different fix. Each message
  wakes its recipient once; work somebody is blocked on comes back on the same
  retry an unacknowledged announcement uses, because a question nobody has
  answered is a peer waiting rather than a decision; and `stop_hook_active` is
  honoured, so a wake never continues a turn a wake already continued. That last
  one is a loop guard rather than a preference, and no setting switches it off.

  `[wake] extend_turn_for` is `all` by default, `urgent` for an operator who
  would rather an FYI never cost a turn, `none` for one who wants Dibs strictly
  pull-shaped. The alternatives trade awareness for tokens, which is a trade
  only the person paying should make deliberately.

- **A board-visibility report that could not be reproduced is now guarded
  instead.** `codex-primary` reported that an agent which had just joined was
  absent from their `check_in` snapshot and from the board app. By the time the
  report was read the event ring had rolled over, so the two plausible causes
  (their snapshot preceded the registration; the client was rendering a panel it
  had cached for the session, which `dibs doctor` warns about by name) cannot be
  told apart after the fact. Measured against a live board: a fresh registration
  is present in the very next `check_in` and in the panel payload. That property
  is now a test over both surfaces, because they are separate code paths and the
  report named both.

- **Three reports from agents on this board, acted on.** `k7-a` found that
  work-overlap matching being OFF surfaced only in a `matching_hint` on
  `declare`, attributed to whichever cwd the daemon last failed to read, so it
  read as another agent's misconfiguration; an agent that registers, checks in
  and works without declaring never learned at all. That is the one state where
  silence must not be read as safety: the board renders normally, same-path
  overlap still works, and nothing looks different. It is now on `check_in`, the
  call documented as the atomic checkpoint, phrased as a board state.

  `k7-b` found that closing a solo space was a two-step ending in an error:
  close_space refused because the space had one member, which was them, and
  leave_space then removed the empty space so the close they had been told to
  make failed with `E_NO_AGENT`. The sole member may now close its own space,
  because the rule exists so nobody tidies away somebody ELSE's working context.
  They also called `close_space(reason: …)` when the parameter is `note`, and
  were told only that `reason` is not accepted; the refusal now names the word
  this surface uses when the tool has one. Not an alias: two names for one thing
  in a schema that is an agent's only documentation is worse than a sentence.

- **Touch ID had been dead since the rename.** `humanauth.helperName` said
  `agents-presence` while `task presence` compiled and installed
  `dibs-presence`, so `findHelper` looked for a file that has never existed on
  any machine and every presence check answered `Unavailable`. Three spellings
  were in play, which is how it happened: `lanes-presence` (v1),
  `agents-presence` (the intermediate rename), `dibs-presence` (what ships). The
  one assertion in Dibs that must not be forgeable by software was silently off,
  and the product's own message for it, "this build ships without the presence
  helper", reads as a packaging decision rather than a typo, so nobody looked.
  Nothing could catch it: the Go tests never exec the helper and the Taskfile
  never reads the constant. `TestThePresenceHelperIsTheOneThatGetsBuilt` now
  pins the two together.

- **The hint shown when a name is taken named a call that cannot work.** It said
  to ask a coordinator to `merge_spaces <new> into <old>`, which takes SPACE ids
  where those are AGENT ids: following it fails with `E_NO_SPACE`. Lane-era
  residue, printed at the one moment mail becomes unreachable, which is the
  worst place in the product for a hint to be wrong. Found by following it.

- **A role held by an agent nobody can become now shows on the board and in
  `dibs doctor`.** The coordinator role is what `force_release`, `close_space`
  and clearing another agent's debris all key on, and held by an unreattachable
  agent it is a power the board shows as filled and nobody can use. Not a
  deadlock, which is what it looks like from inside: `dibs admin coordinator
  <agent>` moves it and a `[roles]` block reapplies it on every start. The gap
  was that nothing pointed at either.

- **The wake path could not reach an agent that had no session, and nothing
  said so.** A lifecycle hook names an agent by the session id its harness
  quotes, and `AgentForHook` deliberately refuses the cwd fallback when a
  supplied session matches nothing, because without that refusal any
  unregistered session in a shared directory was handed another agent's private
  mail. Correct, and it means an agent that registered outside its harness's MCP
  connection carries no session and can never be woken, however well the plugin
  is installed. The stdio bridge sent the session id on `register` alone, which
  is the one call such an agent never made through it; it now rides every tool
  call, and the first authenticated one repairs the binding. The engine refuses
  to overwrite a session an agent already has, so this is a repair and never a
  redirection.

  The second half is why it went unnoticed for days. `poll_unresolved` was
  counted from the day the health check was written and never reached a verdict:
  the check asked whether ANY call resolved, which a machine running several
  agents always answers yes to. So one agent's wake path being completely dead
  read `ok`, and `dibs doctor` printed "harness hooks resolving" while nine
  consecutive polls for that session found nobody. A count nothing reads is not
  a diagnostic, and a partial failure that reads as success is worse than one
  that reads as nothing.

- **A declaration no longer publishes its own prose as a space id.** An
  auto-opened space took its id from the words of the declaration, so a private
  repository's hostnames, service accounts and internal paths became durable
  board objects readable by agents in unrelated repositories, with no way to
  take them back. Ids now come from a ref where there is one (`issue:42` →
  `issue-42`) and otherwise from the project plus a digest.

- **`task install` no longer offers another project's signing identity.**
  `tools/signcheck` listed every code-signing identity in the keychain and
  proposed whichever came first. That is a cross-project dependency established
  by accident, because a macOS privacy grant keyed to a certificate another
  project owns is revoked the moment they rotate it; and printing the list is a
  disclosure, since a keychain holds identities for work that has not been
  announced and this output is the kind of thing that lands in an issue. It now
  looks for `Dibs Local Codesign` by name, names nothing else, and says how to
  create one.

- **The Claude Desktop manifest said version 0.0.0**, and no test could see it:
  it had never been on anybody's list of things to stamp. A list of things to
  keep in sync is itself a thing that falls out of sync, so the list is no
  longer trusted. `TestNoVersionedManifestEscapesTheStamp` goes looking for the
  thing it describes, failing on any JSON in the tree that states a version and
  is neither stamped nor explicitly somebody else's. It found this one
  immediately. The same manifest still carried the retired product name
  `io.agents/agents` and described spaces as "shared agents".

- **A tag is now checked against the changelog it ships.** The version guards
  held the manifests to the changelog, which left the changelog itself
  unverified: forgetting to claim the Unreleased section would publish a release
  whose every manifest named the previous version, with a green gate, because
  the manifests and the changelog agreed with each other about the wrong number.
  The release workflow runs the gate against the tagged commit, so the check
  fails the release rather than the developer, and is silent on an ordinary
  checkout where there is no tag to disagree with.

- **SPEC-CHANNELS.md is readable again.** The `lane` → `agent`/`space` rename
  ran over the document that defines the split, leaving a terminology table
  whose two rows were identical, a sentence with the same plural noun twice in a
  row, and a passage warning about careless renames whose own example had been
  renamed into two identical halves. The
  same sweep reached `internal/web/act.go` and both board templates, which is
  what the operator reads.

### Changed

- **The board panel, first pass: quiet instrument.** It had four nested rail
  systems down the left, an orbiting conic gradient with a blurred breathing
  core for a connection indicator, a diagonal hatch under every line of type,
  two coloured pools of light, glow on the figures and a halo on every live pip.
  Read cold it was instrument-shaped costume, and this file already argued
  twice, about the rail's cross-ticks and the metrics' corner brackets, that
  ornament imitating instrumentation costs a surface the trust it is imitating.
  The same argument finishes the job.

  Monospace now means data and nothing else. It had been marking the node id,
  "read only", group headings, badges, agent names, paths and counts: seven
  roles, which is none. Headings and badges are words, so they are set as words.

  Colour is spent once. "Out of touch" was warm on the heading, its count, every
  affected row's edge and the figure in the summary; it is now the count at the
  top, which says how many, and the edge on each row, which says which.

  The four-cell metric deck is a sentence: `1/16 live · 0 unanswered · 11
  declared · 1 out of touch`. The accessible label already read that way and
  read better than what sighted readers were given.

  And each agent is one line, opened on request. Sixteen agents spending four to
  twelve lines each answered "who else is here and what are they on" only for
  whoever scrolled: a well-written twelve-line declaration pushed the two agents
  that needed attention off the screen. A native `details` carries it, so it is
  keyboard operable and needs no script, and the text is clamped in CSS rather
  than sliced, so the whole declaration stays selectable, searchable and read in
  full by a screen reader. Which rows are open is held by each surface, because
  both rebuild the roster wholesale on every board change and a `details` does
  not survive that: expanding an agent and having the board tick would have
  snapped it shut.

  Two things were simply wrong and are fixed on the way past. The window title
  read `Dibs) Board`, and `Dibs (3 waiting` with mail. And the tab whose id says
  `agents` and whose label said `Dibs` renders SPACES: three names for one
  thing, in the surface a person reads.

- **A permission error now names the route to permission.** `E_NOT_COORDINATOR`
  and `E_NOT_ADMIN` stated the rule and stopped, which leaves a capable agent
  with nothing to do but give up or ask for the tool again. Every honesty hint
  in Dibs names the corrective call; these had none to name, because the
  corrective call is a human's. So they now name the human: send them a
  `request`, which raises a notification with Approve on it and returns their
  answer as an ordinary response.

- **Every message type says what it DOES to its recipient.** An agent choosing
  between `notify`, `question`, `request` and `handoff` was choosing by tone, on
  four labels that read as synonyms for "send". They now say which types wake
  the recipient now and which arrive at their next activation, so an agent can
  pick for the effect and structure the message for what it triggers.

- `tools/list` is 34.0k characters for 44 tools, down from 36.2k for 42. Every
  agent pays it on every cold connection, and the reasoning behind a rule
  belongs in `dibs://skills`, which is fetched once, rather than in the
  description of every tool that follows from it. No corrective detail was
  dropped; the war stories moved.

- Published to the official MCP Registry as `io.github.agenxy/dibs`, on the same
  tag trigger as the release, so the registry entry, the GitHub release and the
  Homebrew cask cannot drift from each other. The registry is where a harness or
  an agent looks up a server it has never heard of, which for this product is
  the audience that matters: the tap serves people who already know the name.
  The publisher is pinned and checksummed rather than piped from a `latest`
  redirect, because that job holds `id-token: write`.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- `GET /livez`, unauthenticated, answering only that the daemon is up.
  Everything else needs the coordination secret, which is right for anything
  that reveals the board and wrong for liveness: supervising Dibs meant handing
  a monitoring system the same secret every agent authenticates with. It leaks
  strictly less than opening a TCP connection to the port already does.

- **A fleet can span machines.** `dibs trust <host:port>` records the certificate
  a remote daemon serves, and `dibs fingerprint` prints what that daemon serves,
  so the two can be compared by eye before anything relies on it. The pairing is
  ssh's, for the same reason: the daemon signs its own certificate and stands up
  no CA, so the first connection has nothing to verify against and the answer is
  to look once and record it. It costs the operator nothing extra, because a
  second machine already needs the coordination secret carried across by hand
  and the fingerprint travels on the same trip. Trusting one daemon trusts only
  that daemon: a machine holding the secret but not the certificate is still
  refused, and so is one that trusts a different certificate.

- **Codex agents can be woken.** Mail is delivered into the session instead of
  waiting for the agent to poll, using Codex's `mcp_tool` hook handler: it calls
  Dibs over the MCP connection the model already holds, with no subprocess, so
  nothing here lets Dibs drive a harness. This was refused for as long as the
  only reachable handler was `command`; that variant now exists, and the doc
  that said it did not ends with the instruction to re-check, which is how it
  was found. Deliberately limited to `SessionStart` and `Stop`: a tool matcher
  guessed wrong fails silently, and Codex's tool names are not verified here yet.

- `task install` honours `DIBS_CODESIGN_IDENTITY`, signing both binaries with a
  persistent identity. macOS keys a privacy grant to a code signature, and the
  Go toolchain signs ad-hoc, so every rebuild is a different program to the
  system and any Files-and-Folders or Full Disk Access grant silently stops
  applying. That matters when checkouts live under Desktop, Documents or
  Downloads, where the daemon needs permission to read them at all.

- `dibs doctor` reports an ad-hoc signed daemon and says what it costs, because
  the symptom (matching worked, then quietly stopped after an install) points at
  everything except the signature.

- `task smoke`, in the gate: it runs the built binaries and asserts on what they
  actually print, against expectations written by hand rather than generated
  from the source. Everything above was invisible to a green suite because the
  rename edited the fixtures and the code together, so the tests agreed with the
  bug: `doctor_test.go` asserted `[mcp_servers.agents]`. A check the sweep cannot
  reach is the only kind that can catch the sweep.

### Changed

- **Matching calibrates its own notify threshold.** The daemon already found the
  repository, indexed it unprompted, and held the scorer and the corpus; it then
  stopped one step short and asked a human to run `dibs calibrate`, read a
  number, and type it into a TOML. Measured cost of the step it declined to
  take: 120ms on this repository, against the indexing it had already done.

  What made that worse than it looks: an unset notify threshold is ZERO, and a
  zero bar mentions every scored match, related or not. The untouched default
  was not "off pending calibration", it was the loudest possible setting, so the
  feature's first impression was noise. Measuring is strictly safer.

  Only the notify bar. `join` stays at 0 unless asked for, because auto-JOINING
  on a measured-but-unreviewed number is a different risk: a wrong mention costs
  a glance, a wrong join costs an agent's membership. What was adopted is logged
  with the false-mention rate it buys and the flag that overrides it.

- **A board written by v0.0.4 or earlier is no longer opened.** `dibd` now says
  so on startup and names the record it will not read. Set the file aside
  (`mv ~/.dibs/ledger.jsonl ~/.dibs/ledger.jsonl.old`) and start it again; your
  work is untouched, the coordination history is not. This is the same clean
  break the 0.0.2 notes describe, applied to the half of the rename that was
  missed, and it is the last one.

- **Work-overlap matching is on by default, and indexes every repository your
  agents work in.** It used to be gated behind `-match-repo`, so the feature
  this product exists for was silent on every install that did not know to set
  a flag. There was no constant to default that flag to, because the daemon
  serves agents across every project open on the machine.

  The fleet already knew the answer: every agent registers with a working
  directory, and the tree containing it is exactly the history worth mining. So
  each repository is indexed the first time an agent turns up in it, up to
  sixteen, and there is one index per repository. An agent is scored by the tree
  it is working in; an agent in a tree that is not indexed gets no semantic
  suggestions rather than someone else's, because a co-change model asked about
  another project's sentence answers confidently and wrongly.

  `-match-repo` remains only as a pre-warm, for a daemon started at login that
  should have an index ready before the first agent arrives. Closes #7.

### Fixed

- **An 11.6 MB compiled binary was committed at the repository root.** A bare
  `go build ./cmd/dibs` writes `./dibs`, and the next `git add -A` swept it in.
  An operator auditing Dibs before trusting it with a fleet called it "the single
  strongest trust smell available": an unexplained committed executable is the
  shape of a supply-chain compromise and nothing in the tree lets a reader verify
  it, so they deleted it and built from source. It also dominated the source
  tarball. Untracked, ignored, and a hygiene test now detects committed
  executables by CONTENT rather than by name, because the file nobody meant to
  add has no extension to match on.

- **Test fixtures inherited the operator's global git config.** They set
  `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1`, which suppresses only the *system* config, so
  `~/.gitconfig` still applied: on a machine that signs commits, `go test ./...`
  popped a GUI credential prompt mid-run and failed naming a signer the
  contributor had never heard of. The fixtures now pin `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` too.

- **`dibs calibrate` mislabelled where its notify number came from.** It always
  said "(median of the same)", but Notify is `max(median, join/2)` and a
  well-discriminating scorer drags the median to zero, so on this repository the
  floor produced 0.199 while the label named a rule that had not been applied.
  An operator read it, correctly inferred from "median" that about half of
  unrelated pairs must clear the bar, and filed that as a finding: sound
  reasoning from a false premise that was ours. The label now names the rule
  that actually ran.

- `dibs calibrate` said what to set and not what it costs. It now prints the
  false-mention rate the suggested `notify_threshold` buys, measured on the same
  population the threshold came from: on this repository, 39% of unrelated pairs
  clear it. That number was always computed and never shown, so the only way to
  learn it was to run a fleet and watch unrelated work get mentioned.

- `declare` reported `matching: "off"` during the first second after an agent
  registers, while the repository was still being indexed. "Off" plus "no
  repository indexed yet" reads as "you have not configured this", so the honest
  response is to go configure something; the correct response was to wait. The
  `indexing` state already existed and nothing ever entered it.

- Repository-hygiene tests failed with `exit status 128` when run from a release
  tarball rather than a checkout, which reads like a broken machine. They skip
  outside a work tree, where the property they assert cannot exist.

- The `type` parameter on `send` carried its enum with an empty description, so
  a client rendering per-parameter help showed a blank for the one parameter
  whose values need explaining.

- The README said `go build` needs "nothing but Go 1.26.5" while `go.mod` pins
  toolchain 1.26.6, which triggers a download that fails hard on a
  restricted-egress network. It names 1.26.6 and mentions `GOTOOLCHAIN=local`.

- **A remote agent's pid was probed on the wrong machine.** The sweep and the
  board both asked this kernel whether a pid was alive, with no check that the
  agent was on this host, so a healthy agent on another machine was declared
  dead and its claims released, and an unrelated local process holding the same
  number reported it alive on evidence about a different program. The stdio
  bridge registers with its own pid, so every remote agent arrives carrying one
  that means nothing on the server: the fault was armed by the same change that
  made remote agents possible. A pid is now evidence only where it can be
  observed; a remote agent falls through to the lease, where silence is judged
  by the clock. An unknown host still counts as local, so existing boards are
  unaffected.

- **The CLI could not talk to its own daemon off loopback.** Every request was
  built as `"http://" + addr()`, in eighteen places, while the daemon serves TLS
  on any address another machine can reach. So the moment a daemon was moved to
  serve a fleet, `dibs board`, `dibs doctor` and the rest failed against a daemon
  that was working perfectly. The client now derives the scheme from the same
  rule the server applies, so the two agree by construction.

- **The self-signed certificate was refused by every Apple client.** It was
  issued for ten years, and macOS and iOS reject any TLS server certificate
  valid for more than 398 days, reporting it as "certificate is not standards
  compliant" and declining to connect at all. The one path that exists to let a
  second machine reach the daemon without a CA therefore did not work on the
  operating system Dibs is mostly run from. Now 365 days, with replacement 30
  days before expiry, because a bounded life that nothing renews is just a later
  outage.

- A refused certificate was reported as **"dibd not running"**. Those need
  opposite actions, and the wrong one was given on exactly the path where
  somebody is bringing up a second machine and has no other signal: they would
  go hunting for a dead process that is alive and well.

- **Upgrading silently demoted every persistent agent to ephemeral.** The
  vocabulary rename changed op field names as well as op kinds, and a renamed
  field does not fail: `lane_kind` was simply not read, so the op applied with
  the field zero and replay reported success over a board that had quietly lost
  its persistent agents (no nonce resume, no coordinator eligibility) while a
  replayed `sweep` that recorded `dead_lanes` marked nobody dead. Every release
  up to v0.0.4 wrote those names. `state == fold(ledger)` was broken with
  nothing raised anywhere, which is the one outcome a hash-chained ledger exists
  to prevent, so the daemon now refuses the ledger instead of misreading it.

  The test that froze the on-disk field names had been guarding this since
  v0.0.0. The sweep rewrote its frozen list to match the new tags, and the
  comment explaining why the list must never be rewritten, which it left saying
  "renames the participant from `Agent` to `Agent`". The list is now
  fingerprinted, so a sweep that rewrites the words fails on the hash it cannot
  recompute.

- The startup check for an outdated board listed the vocabulary it had just been
  renamed *to*, so it recognised `register` and `declare` as obsolete words: on
  any replay failure it told the owner their current board came from 0.0.2 and
  to move it aside. It also only ran when replay had already failed, which the
  case above never does. It now runs before the fold, reads the whole ledger
  rather than the first fifty records, and its words are checked against the
  core rather than a second hand-maintained list.

- Every subcommand's `--help` said `usage: agents <verb>`, and every bad-flag
  error told you to run `agents <verb> --help`. The string lives in one shared
  helper that no named smoke check goes through, so eleven checks on individual
  commands all passed over it. The harness now runs `--help` for every verb the
  binary reports, plus the bad-flag path, matching a stale name only in command
  position: a looser rule failed two verbs on prose that legitimately says
  "agents".

- `dibs doctor` did not notice that the service starts a different daemon than
  the one installed. A unit records an absolute path, so installing from a Go
  workspace once and from `task install` later leaves the service starting the
  first build forever: the daemon answers, every other check passes against it,
  and every fix shipped since is not running. It is checked now, with the `rm`
  and the re-run that fixes it.

- **`declare` told agents that an AGENT had been opened for their work.** Agents
  are not opened; spaces are. The result key was `agents`, each entry carried
  its space id under `agent`, and the hint read "no existing agent cleared the
  match threshold, so one was opened for this work", leaving a declaring agent
  to work out whether Dibs had just invented a peer for it. They are `spaces`,
  `space` and `spaces_hint` now, matching the board resource, which has said
  `spaces` all along. Found by declaring work and reading the answer.

- **`dibs log` silently dropped every registration.** The reader typed the op's
  `agent` field as a string, but on a `register` it is the descriptor object
  (harness, model, cwd), so those lines failed to parse; a line that failed to
  parse was skipped without a word. On the board this was written against, 100
  ledger records rendered as 86 rows. An agent joining is the event people come
  to the log to confirm, and a peer reported a new agent it could corroborate
  nowhere. An unreadable record now says so and costs one line instead of
  vanishing.

- **`board` told the agent the human had seen the board, on hosts that render no
  panel.** The sentence was appended unconditionally: the function was not even
  passed the answer. So the agent reports "I've shown you the board" and the
  human is looking at nothing. It now says what is actually known, which is that
  the board was SENT and whether the host claims it can draw it. It does not
  claim the opposite either: the reference host declares nothing and renders
  from `_meta` regardless.

- `board(detail: true)` returned a summary instead of the board on the host most
  likely to be running. `detail` reached only `content`, and a host that shows
  the model `structuredContent` INSTEAD of `content` drops exactly that, so the
  one documented way for an agent to read the board on purpose answered with one
  sentence and the agent's own token. Found by an agent that wanted the board,
  asked for detail, got nothing usable, and went back to querying the daemon
  over plain HTTP: the tool taught it not to use the tool.

- `subscriptions/listen` did not work through `dibs mcp-stdio`, which is how the
  Claude Code plugin and every other stdio harness connects. The bridge read
  each response to completion before writing it, so a stream that never ends
  hung until a 75-second timeout killed it, silently. Push notifications were
  therefore a direct-HTTP-only feature while the plugin path polled, and nothing
  on either side said so. The bridge now streams that one call on its own
  goroutine, unwrapping SSE frames into JSON-RPC lines, with stdout serialised
  because notifications interleave with replies.

- An unknown resource answered `-32002` to every caller. 2026-07-28 moved
  resource-not-found to `-32602`, on the grounds that JSON-RPC already has
  "invalid params". Dibs serves both revisions from one handler, so the code is
  now the one the calling revision expects, rather than a constant that is wrong
  for half of them.

- A `prune` was never written down, so the record came back on the next restart
  holding its old token. `prune_own` closed the agent in memory and returned
  without advancing the serial, and the engine ledgers exactly when the serial
  moves. The admin `prune` carried a comment about this same fault, three
  functions further down the same file. Every op that changes replayable state
  is now covered by one test that asserts the serial moved, because saying it in
  prose has failed three times: `prune`, `claim_coordinator`, `prune_own`.

- The coordinator could not clear another agent's debris, which is the thing its
  own rationale names. `prune` routes to `prune_own`, which refused every peer,
  and the admin `prune` op is reachable only from the human path, so the role
  granted nothing an ordinary agent did not already have. A coordinator may now
  prune a record that has stopped. Not a live one: an agent that can delete a
  working peer's row can delete the evidence that somebody else is already on
  the objective, and no role gets that.

- The vocabulary rename left `LANES(1)` as the title of the generated man page
  and `agents` as the command it documents, four wire error codes reading
  `E_LANE_*` on a surface with no lanes in it, and their messages rewritten into
  nonsense: closing a space refused with "an agent with agents in it is
  somebody's working context". The codes are `E_SPACE_*` and the messages talk
  about spaces again.

- An argument that did not decode was refused with no `hint`, the one rule this
  surface exists to keep: the agent was told what was wrong and nothing about
  what to do instead. A `register` carrying the pre-0.0.3 nested `agent` object
  got "agent must be a string, got object" and no way to learn the current
  shape. Those three protocol errors now name the call that answers the
  question, as do an unknown resource and an unknown method.

- A coordinator claim that presented the right secret spent it even when the op
  was then refused, leaving the board with no coordinator and no way to appoint
  one short of restarting the daemon. Checking the secret and spending it are
  now separate: the claim is consumed once the grant is ledgered.

- The bound on git calls made the permission it needed impossible to grant. A
  first call against a macOS protected folder puts a dialog on the user's
  screen, and macOS shows that dialog on behalf of the requesting process: a
  20-second timeout killed git while the dialog was still up, leaving the prompt
  with nothing to grant to. The deadline is now four minutes, which is a person
  reading a dialog rather than a hang, and the error says that answering it and
  registering again is all that is needed.

- The daemon identified itself to macOS as `a.out`, the Go toolchain's default,
  so any privacy grant was recorded against a name shared with every other
  ad-hoc binary. `task install` now always sets `org.agenxy.dibs`, whether or
  not a signing identity is configured.

- A repository the daemon could not read was written off for the life of the
  process. Dedup lived in two places: the daemon's, which releases a tree it
  failed to read so a later attempt retries, and the engine's, which never
  cleared. Granting the daemon access and registering again therefore did
  nothing, which is the exact situation the retry existed for.

- `task install` removed `$DEST/agents`, a name that has never existed, and then
  copied over the live `dibs`. That reuses the inode, macOS invalidates the
  cached signature, and every later run is SIGKILLed with no message: precisely
  the failure the comment directly above that line warns about.

- The data directory really is `~/.dibs` now. The 0.0.3 notes below said so and
  the code did not: the vocabulary rename turned every "lane" into an "agent"
  and took `~/.lanes` with it, so two releases shipped writing to `~/.agents`, a
  generic name in the user's home that any number of other tools could claim.
  The same slip put a `.agents` directory inside your repository for monitor
  state. An existing directory is still found and used, under either old name,
  so no board moves and nothing is lost; `dibs doctor` names the one it opened
  and gives you the `mv` if you want it.

- `dibs mcp-config` published the Codex/TOML server block as `[mcp_servers.agents]`
  while the JSON block correctly said `dibs`. Half of that command's output has
  been wrong since 0.0.3.

- The Claude Code plugin did not work at all. Its `.mcp.json` declared
  `"command": "agents"`, a binary that has never existed, so the harness spawned
  it, failed, and showed a server that never started. The Claude Desktop manifest
  and the OpenCode README named the same missing binary.

- The panel resource was advertised as `ui://agents/board` while every other
  resource is `dibs://`.

- The signature-verification command in the README passed
  `--certificate-identity .../Agenxy/agents/...`, so anyone checking a release
  signature got a mismatch and had every reason to think the artifact was bad.

- On Linux `dibs configure --service` wrote `agents.service` and told the
  operator to run `systemctl --user enable --now agents`. systemd also had no
  guard against installing a second unit beside an old one, which launchd has
  had since the `com.agents.dibd` incident: two units on one data directory
  means the second fails the directory lock and reads as a service that will
  not start.

- `dibs doctor` told you to move an inherited data directory without mentioning
  that a service unit pins that path, so following the advice left the daemon
  starting against a directory that was gone.

- `dibs mcp-config` panicked with a Go stack trace on a `local.secret` shorter
  than 16 bytes, which is what a truncated or hand-edited one looks like.

- The README's install line said `brew install agenxy/tap/agents`, naming a cask
  that has never existed, so the first command a new reader runs did nothing.
  It also omitted `brew trust agenxy/tap`, which Homebrew 6 requires before it
  will load a cask from a third-party tap; without it the install fails with a
  trust error.

- The tap offered a stale `lanes` cask beside `dibs`, so `brew install
  agenxy/tap/lanes` still resolved to 0.0.2. It is now a `tap_migrations.json`
  entry, which moves an existing install across on the next `brew update`
  instead of leaving it on a version that gets no releases.

- A `git` the daemon ran against a tree could hang forever, and matching would
  wait on it in silence. On macOS `/usr/bin/git` dispatches into Xcode, and from
  a launchd agent against a protected folder (Desktop, Documents, Downloads) it
  blocks on an access prompt that can never be shown to a background process, so
  it never returns rather than failing. Found on a real machine: a `rev-parse`
  child sat there for four minutes, the indexing goroutine never finished, and
  because that repository was already latched as in-progress every later
  registration was deduplicated against work that would never complete.

  Every git the daemon runs is now bounded, and a tree it cannot read is named
  in the log and in `dibs doctor` along with the likely cause, instead of
  leaving matching quietly off. Unbounded work behind a deduplicating latch is a
  permanent silent failure, which is the shape this codebase keeps paying for.

### Security

- Go 1.26.6, which closes six standard-library advisories the 1.26.5 toolchain
  is subject to, four of them reachable from code this daemon runs
  (`http.Server.Serve`, `ServeTLS`, `http.Client.Do`).

## [0.0.4] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- The rename left the old name in places only running the binary would show:
  `dibs version` printed `agents`, `dibs doctor` looked for a binary called
  `agents` on PATH and for an MCP server of that name in harness configs,
  `mcp-config` generated a server block named `agents`, every error prefix and
  the "did you mean" suggestion said `agents`, the shell completions declared
  `#compdef agents`, and the daemon's self-signed certificate carried it as its
  common name. Found by exercising the CLI rather than reading the diff, which
  is how it should have been found before 0.0.3.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-08-11

### Changed

- **Lanes is now Dibs.** The name collided with an established project in the
  same niche, and described the opposite of what this does: everywhere else a
  "lane" is an isolated parallel workstream, while here it was an agent's
  identity on a shared board.
  - The CLI is `dibs`, the daemon is `dibd`, the environment is `DIBS_*`, the
    data directory is `~/.dibs`, and resources are `dibs://`.
  - `brew install agenxy/tap/dibs`. The old cask still installs 0.0.2 and is
    not updated further.
- **A lane is now an agent, and a lane of work is now a space.** Both concepts
  were called lanes, which is why the tool names never quite made sense. A space
  is where semantically-related work congregates, and what draws agents into one
  is a match rather than a rule, so "lane" was the wrong shape for it.
- **Tool names are verb-first and drop the noun where nothing else could be
  meant.** `register`, `resume`, `update`, `sign_off`, `check_in`, `board`,
  `declare`, `undeclare`, `open_space`, `join_space`, `leave_space`,
  `close_space`, `read_space`, `merge_spaces`, `watch_space`, `lock_space`,
  `unlock_space`, `post`, `announce`, `ack_announcement`, `admit`, `evict`,
  `send`, `read_mail`, `ack`.

### Breaking

- **A 0.0.2 board cannot be replayed by 0.0.3.** The ledger records op kinds by
  name and those names changed, so the daemon refuses to start rather than serve
  a board that disagrees with its own history. It says which word it found, the
  one command that fixes it, and asks the agent reading it to tell you what was
  set aside. Sorry: one clean break at 0.0.x beat two later.

### Fixed

- A ledger line that was valid JSON but carried no op panicked the daemon
  instead of being reported as corruption.
- `verify --json` dropped the corrective hint the prose keeps, so a board that
  had never run reported `open …: no such file` and nothing else on the surface
  agents read. Thanks to @shaurya703 (#17).

## [0.0.2] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- `dibs completion <bash|zsh|fish>` prints a completion script, generated from
  the verb table the CLI dispatches on so it cannot drift from the commands that
  exist. Thanks to @shaurya703 (#15).
- `dibs man` renders the manual page from the same help text `dibs help`
  prints, and releases ship `lanes.1` in the archive and the Homebrew cask, so
  `man dibs` answers after an install. Thanks to @shaurya703 (#16).

- Nine real Git configurations are now regression tests. Each builds actual
  repositories, registers agents through the actual server, and asserts on the
  warning an agent would receive: an orphan `--single-branch` clone, a vendored
  subtree, shallow clones with removed origins, case-variant remotes, a stale
  url after a rename, a `git replace` graft. Synthetic values proved the
  decision and never exercised the resolver, which is how several of the defects
  fixed in this release reached a review rather than a test.
- Two standards are now checked rather than remembered. `internal/hygiene`
  fails the build on a shell script entering the tracked tree, by extension or
  by shebang, and on an em dash in prose. The shebang is read the way `env`
  reads it, quoting included, and anything that cannot be shown to be shell-free
  is treated as shell. En dashes are flagged only when spaced,
  since a numeric range is correct typography.
- The board says which project each agent is in. A machine usually has more
  than one repository open, and agents in three of them all reported branch
  `main`, so the rows were indistinguishable. The project is resolved from the
  agent's working directory once, at registration, and recorded, so it names the
  project even when the agent is several directories inside it.

### Changed

- **Dibs is now Apache 2.0**, relicensed from MIT. Both are permissive; Apache
  grants patent rights from contributors explicitly, terminates the licence of
  anyone who sues over the covered code, and states that no trademark rights come
  with it. `NOTICE` retains the MIT notice for the contributions made under it.
- `dibs doctor` exits nonzero when it finds a problem, so a script can act on it
  rather than parsing the output. Thanks to @floze-the-genius (#6).
- The Homebrew tap moved from `agenxy/homebrew-agents` to `agenxy/homebrew-tap`,
  so the install line is `brew install agenxy/tap/lanes` rather than repeating
  the project name. GitHub keeps a redirect, so the old form still works and
  nobody who already tapped needs to act.
- The README leads with a worked example of a collision being caught, and the
  documentation says `dibs stop` wherever it used to say `pkill dibd`.
- The service identifier is `org.agenxy.dibs`.
- An unstamped build reports `devel+<revision>` rather than a version number
  that names a release it is not.
- Prose throughout uses ordinary punctuation.
### Fixed

- A refused port said only `bind: address already in use`. It now names the
  dibd already holding the address, or says the holder is something else and
  how to find it. It does not fall back to another port: clients resolve the
  daemon from a fixed address, so one that quietly moved would be a daemon
  nobody could find.
- `com.agents.dibd` was missing from the labels the service installer checks
  before writing a new unit, so upgrading from that vintage could leave two jobs
  contending for one data directory.
- Repository identity survives three Git configurations that previously made two
  clones of one project look like strangers: a shallow clone (which does not have
  its root commit, so it now records none rather than a boundary), `git replace
  --graft` (identity is read with replacement objects disabled), and
  `url.*.insteadOf` (the effective remote is resolved instead of the configured
  string).
- Repository identity is re-read when a directory becomes a repository. A path
  observed before `git init` was remembered as not-a-repository for the life of
  the daemon, so an agent there was filed as being nowhere: no project on the
  board, and no identity for anything else to reason with.
- Repository identity is re-read when a checkout path is reused. It was memoised
  by path with no expiry, so after `rm -rf project && git clone something-else
  project` a long-running daemon went on describing the repository that used to
  be there, missing collisions inside the new project and inventing them against
  the old. The Git common directory is now checked on every cache hit.
- A shell reached through a tracked symlink is caught. A link named
  `fixture-python` pointing at `/bin/zsh`, plus a file whose shebang named it,
  ran under zsh while the check passed: both the walker and the reader follow
  symlinks, so nothing ever saw the link itself.
- Repository identity is decided by positive evidence in three forms: the same
  Git common directory, the same canonicalised remote, or equal root-commit sets.
  Root sets known on both sides and unequal mean different projects; everything
  else is unknown, and unknown warns.
  - Remotes are compared case-insensitively, because every forge people use
    serves `Acme/Api` and `acme/api` as one repository.
  - Roots are compared for EQUALITY rather than overlap. `git subtree add`
    imports a dependency's whole history, so two unrelated projects that vendored
    the same library share a root commit, and treating that as proof fired the
    strongest signal Dibs has between strangers.
  - The remote outranks history, because history can legitimately differ inside
    one project: a `--single-branch` clone of an orphan branch, or a history
    rewritten by filter-repo, shares no commit with its sibling.
  - A consequence worth knowing: two forks have equal root sets and are treated
    as one project, which is usually right, since a fork's references normally
    name the upstream tracker.
- A ref such as `issue:42` matched across repositories, so two agents in two
  projects were told they were pursuing the same objective: the strongest signal
  Dibs emits, telling each to stop work nothing else was doing. Refs are
  repository-scoped now, using an identity recorded at registration. The
  same-repository case, including two linked worktrees and two clones of one
  upstream, still reports as before.
- `systemd` expands `$VAR` inside `ExecStart` even though it is not a shell, so
  a daemon path containing a dollar sign started whatever the environment said.
  Literal dollars are escaped.
- A path containing U+FFFE or U+FFFF passed validation and was then silently
  rewritten by the XML encoder, producing a LaunchAgent pointing at a different
  data directory. Characters XML cannot represent are refused.
- The corrective commands printed when an older service unit is found were not
  shell-quoted, so a path containing a space was not runnable as shown.
- `dibs stop --help --force` printed help and exited 0, while `--force --help`
  refused: an unknown argument is now refused whichever side of help it sits.
- The em-dash removal replaced placeholder glyphs with commas in places that are
  not prose: a zero timestamp rendered as `seen , ` in the CLI and on the board,
  table cells meaning "not applicable" became `, `, and several comments and
  error strings were left starting mid-sentence.
- Documentation promised automatic subagent stamping everywhere. The
  `PreToolUse` stamp exists only where a harness offers a hook Dibs can use
  without spawning a subprocess, which today means Claude Code. `dibs doctor`,
  the README, `SKILLS.md` and `SPEC-SUPERVISION.md` now say so.
- An agent whose working directory exceeded 128 bytes could not register at all.
  A cwd was bounded as if it were a name; it is a path. Any checkout a few levels
  inside a home directory hit it, and the refusal was of the whole
  `register`, not of the field.

- `dibs stop --help` stopped the daemon. The dispatch discarded its arguments,
  so asking a destructive command what it does performed it and exited 0.
  `dibs configure --service --help` had the same defect and wrote a LaunchAgent.
- Service units generated by `configure --service` mishandled ordinary paths. A
  directory containing `&` produced a plist launchd will not parse; on Linux,
  spaces split one path into several arguments, `%` expanded as a systemd
  specifier, and a newline could inject a second directive. Paths containing
  control characters are now refused rather than silently altered.
- A relative `DIBS_DIR` was written into the unit verbatim, so the service
  started against whatever it resolved to under the init system.
- Upgrading from a unit written by an earlier version created a second job for
  the same data directory. The directory lock refuses the second, which looks
  like a service that will not start; `configure --service` now stops and says
  how to remove the old one.
- `Daemon.IsStranger` canonicalised only one side of its comparison, so with
  `DIBS_DIR` set, or on a symlinked path, every daemon looked like a stranger
  including itself.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Repairs the release identity. See 0.0.0 below; that version cannot be
  installed with `go install` and is retracted in `go.mod`.

### Added

- `dibs stop`, which stops the daemon for this data directory and leaves other
  daemons on the machine running. The documentation previously said
  `pkill dibd`, which ends every fleet on the host.
- `dibs configure --service` writes a launchd or systemd unit, so the daemon
  survives a closed terminal and a reboot.

## [0.0.0] - 2026-08-09

**Retracted. Do not use.** The tag was moved after the Go module proxy had
cached it, and `sum.golang.org` is append-only, so `go install …@v0.0.0` fails
with a checksum error under `GOPROXY=direct` and serves an older tree through
the default proxy. A moved tag cannot be repaired.

First public release. Everything below is what v0 ships with rather than a list
of changes from something earlier: there is no earlier.

### Coordination

- Dibs, slots and advisory path claims over an append-only, hash-chained JSONL
  ledger. Replay is exact (`state == fold(ledger)`), so the persistence is the
  audit history; `dibs verify` checks the chain.
- Private mailboxes with typed messages: question, request, notify, handoff,
  with delivery receipts, deadlines and idempotent retries.
- Ephemeral and persistent agents; standing roles sleep as `dormant` with durable
  mailboxes and wake by resuming.
- MCP-native: 40 advertised tools over the 2026-07-28 stateless contract, with
  the legacy 2025-11-25 path for current hosts. Five more are callable but not
  listed: the lifecycle hooks a harness invokes on the agent's behalf. A tool an
  agent cannot correctly call is not a capability, it is a trap.
- A coordinator can retire a finished agent with `close_space`. Auto-opened agents
  end themselves when their last member leaves; an agent a human opened outlives
  its members on purpose, and until now nothing could ever end one, so a board
  accumulated finished agents permanently and E_LANE_LIMIT advised a fix that did
  not work for them. Refuses an occupied agent, and one holding an unacknowledged
  announcement.
- The human can act from the board panel, proving they are there with Touch ID
  (the admin password on machines without a sensor). **Binary releases do not
  include the Touch ID helper.** It is a small compiled Swift program that has
  to sit beside the binaries, and the release pipeline builds Go; a Homebrew or
  archive install therefore falls back to the admin password, which is a
  supported path rather than a broken one. `task install`, or a build from
  source on a Mac with the Xcode command line tools, produces it. Dibs reports
  the sensor as `unavailable` and sends you to the password: it never claims a
  human was checked when none was. What they get back is an
  ordinary agent identity, not a privileged one: every action is the same op an
  agent would send, so nothing in the state machine learns that humans exist.
  A cancelled request is reported as `abandoned`, never as a decline: a client
  that disconnects or a daemon shutting down is not a person who was asked and
  said no, and telling somebody they changed their mind about a prompt they never
  saw is the kind of claim this path exists to avoid.
  The check cannot be disabled by configuration: there is a scripted-verdict mock
  for development, but it lives behind a build tag, so the code that reads it is
  not compiled into a release binary at all. An environment variable is inert in
  a shipped build, and two tests, one in the untagged build, one against a real
  release daemon with the variable already set, hold that line.
- An agent whose chosen name is taken is told so, and told by what. Asking for
  `sol` and being handed `sol-4` used to be silent, so an agent could publish an
  address nobody could write to and never learn why the mail stopped. The suffix
  itself stays, a stale agent still owns its mailbox, and giving its name away
  would redirect somebody else's mail, but the note names the holder, says
  whether it is a live conflict or a retired agent holding an id the ledger still
  refers to, and points at reattach if the older agent is in fact you.
- Dibs-issued coordination keys. Opening or joining an agent hands the agent an
  opaque key; declared back in `refs`, later work is matched to that agent exactly
  instead of inferred from wording. Checked rather than trusted, a key the
  declaring agent does not hold is struck out, so copying one buys nothing, and
  inherited down a vouched parent/child lineage, which is what lets one
  coordination decision cover a whole fan-out of subagents.

### Duplicate-work matching (spaces)

- Agents declare work in their own words and are matched against work already in
  flight, using the repository's file layout and git co-change history. No model,
  download or network required for the floor.
- Optional embedding tier behind one endpoint, so MLX, llama.cpp, Ollama or a
  hosted API all satisfy it. An unreachable service degrades to the built-in
  scorer and records `degraded` rather than failing.
- `dibs calibrate` measures thresholds against your own repository's history and
  reports how much genuinely-related work clears the bar, not just a number.
  **Recalibrate if you measured a bar before this release**, because the runtime
  now gates on the quantity calibration actually measures. `dibs calibrate`
  scores one declaration against another; the runtime used to score a declaration
  against an agent's MERGED footprint, so the bar was measured on one thing and
  applied to another, and nothing said so. A candidate is now judged against the
  closest single live declaration: the same comparison, at last. The merged
  footprint was diluted by every other member, so the same pair scores higher
  now: measured on this repository, one scenario moved 0.29 → 0.45.
- Matching stays off until a repository is configured, and auto-join stays off
  until a threshold is measured.
- Repository identity comes from Git, not from the shape of two paths: linked
  worktrees are recognised as one repository, and separate clones as separate.
  Three-valued, so "Git is not installed" and "different repositories" are not
  the same answer. Resolved off the state loop, so no agent waits on `git`.

### Supervision

- Detects whether a spawned subagent is working, thinking, blocked or stuck, from
  process liveness, CPU duty cycle and transcript growth.
- Elapsed time is measured on a monotonic clock, so a sleeping machine does not
  read as a stalled fleet.
- Attribution survives detaching, daemonisation and reparenting: in Claude
  Code, a `PreToolUse` hook stamps a spawned command with its parent's agent.
- Reports and never acts: it hands back the command to resume a stalled child
  rather than running it.

### Surfaces

- Live web board: server-rendered, SSE-streamed, dark/light, no framework and no
  build step. Gated on an admin password the agents do not hold.
- Terminal board that degrades cleanly under pipes, redirection and `NO_COLOR`.
- `dibs doctor`, which names the fix rather than only the fault.
- Board panel as an MCP App, which fills from whichever carrier a host actually
  forwards, tool-result `_meta`, ordinary content, or by fetching the board
  itself, and says so plainly when a host forwards none, rather than showing an
  empty board that looks like a server fault.
- The MCP server DELIVERS its own plugin. `dibs://plugin` carries the actual
  files, manifest, hooks, skill, MCP server definition, so an agent with no
  network and no checkout can install one, and an ordered setup procedure where
  every step says how to check it took effect. On first registration an agent is
  told whether a plugin exists for the harness it just named, and whether its
  lifecycle hooks have ALREADY reached this daemon: installed on disk and
  actually loaded are different claims, and only the daemon can tell them apart.
  Harnesses with hooks but no wake path are told mail is still pull-only there,
  rather than being invited to stop checking.
- `check_in` costs the model half what it did. It is the one tool every agent
  must call every activation, and it returned the whole checkpoint twice: once
  in `content` and again, identically, in `structuredContent`. The duplicate
  existed for hosts that drop `_meta` and forbid an app from calling tools, where
  it is the panel's only carrier; a panel that has successfully called through
  the bridge proves the host is not one of those, so the copy stops. Measured:
  6472 model-facing bytes before, 3238 after, with `content` unchanged.
- `task panel:inspect` renders that panel against the live daemon and prints what
  it DREW as text, with switches to withhold each carrier on purpose. Diagnosing
  a panel from a screenshot is how the carrier bug survived a green suite, and
  `--unlock` drives the human lock so the unlocked panel is observable without a
  person putting a finger on a sensor.
- The panel marks an agent going out of touch, once, as it happens: that agent's
  line to the board retracts and returns amber. It is the board's most
  consequential change and it used to occur in silence, between two frames. A
  agent that changes state also TRAVELS to its new status group rather than
  vanishing from one and reappearing in another, so a change of state reads as
  one event instead of two unrelated edits: both directions, because recovery
  is worth seeing too.
- The board panel is drawn as a spine rather than a stack of cards. Records hang
  off the status rail instead of each sitting in a bordered, filled, bevelled
  box that repeated what the group headers already said; a reading of zero that
  needs no action steps back so the exceptions carry the row; name, current work
  and standing description are ranked instead of typeset alike; and an
  out-of-touch timestamp is marked uncertain with a dotted rule rather than
  struck through, which had said the one number worth reading was void.

### Platform

- Verified on macOS. Builds for Linux and arm64 on every push; behaviour on a GNU
  userland is unverified: see README §Platform.
